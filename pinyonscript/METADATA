description: <p>Pinyon Script is a romantic round hand \
  script style font. It also sports swashes which \
  are confident and showy somehow giving the type \
  a feeling suggestive of the American west. \
  Perhaps this is why, despite refinement and \
  aristocratic style; Pinyon Script manages to \
  feel so friendly. Nicole Script uses a \
  high stroke contrast and is very slanted \
  making it most suitable for use at \
  larger sizes.</p>
