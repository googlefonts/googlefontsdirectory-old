description: <p>Alike Angular is a complementary \
  titling style to Alike Regular. It shares the \
  same proportions as its counterpart for \
  compatibility, and is designed for larger display \
  sizes.</p> \
  <p>As opposed to the soft Regular its letterforms \
  consist of only straight splines and additional \
  expressive features are introduced in characters \
  like T, Z, M, E.</p> \
  <p>Designed by Sveta Sebyakina, Alexei Vanyashin \
  from 2009 and first released in 2011 by Cyreal.</p>
