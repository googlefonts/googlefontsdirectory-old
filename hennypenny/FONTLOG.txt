FONTLOG for the Henny Penny font

This file provides detailed information on the Henny Penny 
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Henny Penny font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Henny Penny is an offbeat display font with loads of personality, 
named in honour of the fairy-tale character chicken Henny Penny. 
It is a friendly and playful decorative typeface. Its classical 
nature is successfully hidden behind its very informal structure: 
There is no common baseline, no common character size and no 
common slope of the letters. This makes the typeface very 
amusing. HennyPenny is a headline typeface for use in large 
size fonts. It may be used for children’s books, magazines 
and websites.

Designed by Olga Umpeleva for BrownFox foundry.

HennyPenny is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script.
