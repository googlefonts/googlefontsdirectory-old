description: <p>My older sister Emily and I have \
  been inseparable best friends for years. \
  As children, we signed notes to each other \
  with 'Love Ya Like a Sister' and \
  then giggled at the irony of writing that when \
  we were, in actuality, sisters. This nerdy \
  habit has continued for years. \
  I created this font to honor my friendship \
  with Emily and the many ways she has inspired \
  me and taught me in life.</p>
