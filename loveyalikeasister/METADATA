description: <p>My older sister Emily and I have \
  been inseparable best friends for years. \
  As children, we signed notes to each other \
  with 'Love Ya Like a Sister' and \
  then giggled at the irony of writing that when \
  we were, in actuality, sisters. This nerdy \
  habit has continued for years. \
  I created this font to honor my friendship \
  with Emily and the many ways she has inspired \
  me and taught me in life.</p>

profile: <p>I enjoy creative arts of every kind including theater, photography, and graphic design.  After graduating with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Liberal Studies, I became a stay-at-home mom.   Creating fonts allowed me to use my love of art in a new way while I was at home with my daughters.</p><p>I am passionate about God, orphan care, and sustainable development.  I enjoy studying languages in my spare time.  I live in Tianjin, China with my husband and 2 daughters.</p>
