description: <p>Carter is a reworking of particular casual \
  typeforms that were popular around the mid Twentieth \
  Century, often found used areas such advertising or pulp \
  fiction book covers. The letter forms of Carter have \
  been reshaped and digitised for use as a webfont, the \
  counters have been opened up a little and the stems \
  optimised for use as display font for modern web \
  browsers.</p>
