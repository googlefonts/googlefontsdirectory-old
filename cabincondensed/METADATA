description: <p>This is the condensed set of styles in the \
  Cabin font family; a humanist sans \
  with 4 weights plus true italics, inspired by Edward \
  Johnston’s and Eric \
  Gill’s typefaces, with a touch of modernism.</p> \
  <p>Cabin incorporates modern proportions, \
  optical adjustments, and some elements \
  of the geometric sans.</p> \
  <p>It remains true to its roots, \
  but has its own personality.</p> \
  <p>The weight distribution is almost monotone, \
  although top and bottom curves are slightly \
  thin.</p> \
  <p>Counters of the b, g, p and q are rounded \
  and optically adjusted. The curved stem \
  endings have a 10 degree angle. E and F \
  have shorter center arms. M is splashed.</p>

# Note: weight values are slightly inconsistent, as original checkin
# used "bold", but additional weights added have numeric values.
