description: <p>Playfair is a transitional design. \
  From the time of enlightenment in the late 18th \
  century, the broad nib quills were replaced by \
  pointed steel pens. This influenced typographical \
  letterforms to become increasingly detached from \
  the written ones. Developments in printing \
  technology, ink and paper making, made it \
  possible to print letterforms of high contrast \
  and delicate hairlines.</p> \
  <p>This design lends itself to this period, \
  and while it is not a revival of any particular \
  design, it takes influence from the designs \
  of printer and typeface designer John \
  Baskerville, the punchcutter William Martin’s \
  typeface for the ‘Boydell Shakspeare’ (sic) \
  edition, and from the ‘Scotch Roman’ designs \
  that followed thereafter.</p> \
  <p>As the name indicates, Playfair Display \
  is well suited for titling and headlines. It \
  has an extra large x-height and short descenders. \
  It can be set with no leading if space is tight, \
  for instance in news headlines, or for stylistic \
  effect in titles. Capitals are extra short, and \
  only very slightly heavier than the lowercase \
  characters. This helps achieve a more even \
  typographical colour when typesetting proper \
  nouns and initialisms. Languages, like German, \
  where nouns are capitalized, particularly \
  benefit from this lower contrast between lower \
  and upper case glyphs. In German, with it's \
  many capitalized words, and other European \
  languages that use many diacritical characters, \
  it is advised to use more leading.</p> \
  <p>Being a transitional design, stylistically \
  Playfair can accompany Georgia, where Georgia \
  is used for body text.</p> \
  <p>Playfair includes a full set of small \
  caps, common ligatures, and discretionary \
  ligatures. For Polish, a set of alternate \
  diacritical characters designed with \
  ‘kreska’s are included. All European languages \
  using the latin script are supported. →A set \
  of eight arrow devices are also included←.</p>
