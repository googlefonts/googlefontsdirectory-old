description: <p>Playfair Display is a transitional design. \
  From the time of enlightenment in the late 18th century, \
  the broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens. \
  This influenced typographical letterforms to become \
  increasingly detached from the written ones. Developments \
  in printing technology, ink and paper making, made it \
  possible to print letterforms of high contrast and \
  fine hairlines.</p> \
  <p>This design lends itself to this period, and while it \
  is not a revival of any particular design, it take \
  influence from the printer and typeface designer John \
  Baskerville’s designs, the punchcutter William Martin’s \
  typeface for the ‘Boydell Shakespeare’ (sic) edition, and \
  from the ‘Scotch Roman’ designs that followed thereafter.</p> \
  <p>As the name indicates, Playfair Display is well suited \
  for titling and headlines. It has an extra large x-height \
  and short decenders, that enable it to be set with no \
  leading. Stylistically it can accompany Georgia when \
  Georgia is used for body text.</p> \
  <p>Playfair includes a full set of small caps, common \
  ligatures, and discretionary ligatures. For Polish, a \
  set of alternate diacritical characters designed with \
  ‘kreska’s are included. All European languages using \
  the latin script are supported. A set of eight arrow \
  devices are also included.</p>
