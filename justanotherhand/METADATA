description: <p>My personal handwriting has changed a \
  number of times over the years. Just Another Hand is \
  a narrow brush drawn handwriting font, inspired by \
  the handwriting of my high school days. There's a \
  little artistic license taken with Just Another \
  Hand in the sense that while I never really wrote \
  with a brush in high school, I wanted a cleaner \
  stroke for this interpretation.</p> \
  <p>A little personality, a little restraint... \
  a style that works for all sorts of projects \
  across the board.</p>
