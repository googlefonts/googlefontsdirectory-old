<p><strong>Foundry: <a href="http://www.sorkintype.com">Sorkin Type Co</a></strong></p>

<p>Asset was inspired by the engraved letters found on United States dollar
bills. Asset belongs to the "fat face" category because it is so bold or
heavy. It is also a high contrast design and very extended or wide. Although
it is legible at medium sizes it will shine most when used large where both
its restraint and passion can be seen. This font was made specifically to be
web type, however it will work well in print as well.</p>
