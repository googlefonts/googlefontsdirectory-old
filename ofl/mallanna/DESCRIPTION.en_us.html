Mallanna is a Telugu font with round letterforms and a uniform thickness that reminds us of the round pearls Hyderabad is famous for. 
It looks very crisp even at small point sizes, which helps publishers make beautiful designs, and includes complex Telugu conjunct letters.
Mallanna is named after the Telugu poet from the court of the king Krishnadevaraya, and was one of the Astadiggajalu (literally eight legends) there.
