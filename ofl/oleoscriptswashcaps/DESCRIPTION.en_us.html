It is perfect for situations where a quaint and casual lettering 
effect is desired. Suitable for various typography contexts 
including captions, headlines, packaging, invitations, cards, 
posters, advertising, greeting cards, and book jackets.</p>

and Bold. It has also a

<p>Oleo Script Swash Caps is a Unicode typeface 
family that supports languages that use the Latin script and 
its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts.
