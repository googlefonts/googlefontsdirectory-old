<p>Merriweather was designed to be a text face that is pleasant to read on screens.</p> <p>Merriweather is an evolving and will be updated. As of now there are 4 styles: Regular, Light, Bold, and Black. There will also be Italic in each of these weights. And fairly soon after that there will also be a sans serif version which mirrors the weights and styles of the Serif design.</p> <p>Designed by Eben Sorkin, Merriweather features a very large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, a mild diagonal stress, sturdy serifs and open forms.</p> <p>Because Merriweather is a work in progress and will be improved regularly. This means you can request improvements and even fund specific features if if they are outside of the current scope of work.
