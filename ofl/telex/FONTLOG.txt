FONTLOG for Telex font

This file provides detailed information on the Telex font
Software.

font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Telex is a humanist sans serif conceived to be a web font with 
nice legibility at normal text sizes. Originally based on grid 
fitting shapes it became a multi-purpose typeface with low 
contrast, open counter forms, wide proportions and a touch 
of freshness.

It is ideal for paragraph text on websites (blogs, news) 
and also for printed text.

Designed by Andrés Torresi for Huerta Tipográfica
