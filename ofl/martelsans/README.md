Martel Sans
===========

Martel Sans is a libre font development project. Currently, support for the Devangari and Latin scripts is offered. The Devanagari character set is a monolinear design based on that from the Martel Devanagari libre font project. The Latin character set is an original design. Both character sets are the work of Dan Reynolds and Mathieu RÃ©guer.

Martel Sans will be available for free via the Google Web Fonts project. 

The Martel Sans typeface is designed for typesetting immersive-style documents. It may be be used to set long passages of text in languages that are written in the Devanagari script, including Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, Sanskrit, etc. Martel Devanagari is a readable typeface whose glyph proportions are inspired by traditional writing and calligraphic styles. Its high-contrast strokes have a diagonal axis, in keeping with the pen-angle most often used for the Devanagari writing system.

Two folders are hosted here: <em>Martel Sans Font Files</em> and <em>Martel Sans Source Files</em>. The font files folder  contain both PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts (.otf) and TrueType-flavored fonts (.ttf). The .ttf-files are auto-hinted with ttfautohint version 1.3. All of the font files will be generated with the Glyphs 2 (beta version) font editing application. The source files folder contain a native Glyphs file as well as UFOs exported from Glyphs.

All files are offered as-is.
