<p>Prof Thomas Reuter of the Asia Institute explains that the Balinese
alphabet is named after its first (five) letters, A-NA-CA-RA-KA, similar to
the English term, A-B-C. Balinese characters (aksara bali) are of Indic
origin, but have been adapted for writing the Balinese language, a language of
the Austronesian family of languages. It is spoken by about three million
people on the island of Bali, Indonesia, and among some Balinese immigrant
communities on other Indonesian islands. The Balinese alphabet is of a type
known as abugida, and was derived from the Old Jawanese (Kawi) script, which
in turn derived from the Brahmi script that is the source of all Indic and
Southeast Asian abugidas. Several Indic characters were dropped because they
do not occur in the Balinese language. This type of script is a segmentary
system of consonants ending in the vowel 'a' unless modified with a secondary
but obligatory vowel notation. The earliest bronze inscription in Indic script
in Bali dates from the ninth century.</p>

<p>The use of Balinese script has been largely superseded by Latin script,
except in ritual contexts, because Balinese script is not deemed appropriate
for use in public space, which is dominated by the official language of
Indonesia (bahasa indonesia). Even traditional lontar manuscripts are
gradually being transcribed to make them more accessible to a younger
generation. Although the script is still taught in primary school, few people
use it on a daily basis. For serious students of classical literature,
knowledge of the Balinese script remains essential.</p>

<p>In 1988, I Madé Suatjana first attempted to create a font for Aksara Bali
using the DOS based ChiWriter. Although there was a lot of excitement about
this effort, the font was difficult to use and the letters weren't as rounded
and connected as the writing system required. In 1996, Pak Suatjana improved
the shape of the letters by creating a Windows based font, called Bali Simbar.
The font was better shaped, although it was still quite difficult to use
because of the idiosyncrasies of Balinese.</p>

<p>In 2005, in a seminar was held for the purpose of entering Aksara Bali into
Unicode and ISO 10646, sponsored by the Balinese Government Department of
Culture and Yayasan Bali Galang, a foundation promoting the use of Askara Bali
(Balinese script) under the direction of Donny Harimurti and his sons Bemby
Bantara Narendra and Dendy Narendra. The following year, it was entered into
Unicode, although it was categorized as "still having some difficulties."</p>

<p>There are now two fonts available for Aksara Bali: Bali Simbar Dwijendra,
developed by I Madé Suatjana written in Visual Basic which uses the program
Keyman to manipulate the keyboard for Word; and Bali Galang Smart Font,
developed by Donny Harimurti and his sons, which can only be used with
applications which are integrated with the Graphite engine (for example,
Firefox with Graphite enabled, and Open Office). We are grateful to the
engineers at Google for allowing Aksara Bali to be used as a web font.</p>
