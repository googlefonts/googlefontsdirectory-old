FONTLOG for the Cantora fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Cantora Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Cantora fonts and any
derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Cantora ('Singer' in Spanish) is a friendly semi formal, semi condensed, semi
sans serif. It has reminiscences of hand lettering, mixing straight and bowed
stems, and natural curves.

It was born as an experiment in drawing from the outside to the inside
(drawing the space surrounding the letters first, instead of drawing the
letters themselves). Trying to apply the ideas and methods of Michael Harvey
and Evert Bloemsma to my own glyphs construction.

Although Cantora is a sans, the lowercase letters have proportions typical of
serif fonts. It's perfect for headlines (H1, H2, H3) in sizes larger than
20px.

Cantora characters set covers 103 Latin languages: Afar, Afrikaans, Albanian,
Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarusian, Bislama, Bosnian, Breton, Catalan, Chamorro,
