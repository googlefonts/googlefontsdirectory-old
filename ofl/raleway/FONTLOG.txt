FONTLOG for the Raleway fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Raleway Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Raleway fonts and any
derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. Initially designed by
Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino
Marini.

It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining
numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of
diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric
sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character 
set.

It also has a sister family, Raleway Dots.

Also, the characters set has been expanded to cover 95 languages: Afar,
Afrikaans, Albanian, Basque, Bislama, Breton, Catalan, Chamorro, Chichewa,
Comorian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Faroese, Fijian,
Filipino/Tagalog, Finnish, Flemish, French, Gaelic, Gagauz, German, Gikuyu,
Gilbertese/Kiribati, Greenlandic, Guarani, Haitian_Creole, Hawaiian,
