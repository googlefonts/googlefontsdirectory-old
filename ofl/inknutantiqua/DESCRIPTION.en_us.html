Inknut Antiqua is an Antiqua typeface for litterature and long-form text.
It is designed to evoke Venetian incunabula and humanist manuscripts.
It comes with a complement of typographical sorts and OpenType features for the purpose.
The proportions of Inknut Antiqua make it well suited for low-resolution screens.
