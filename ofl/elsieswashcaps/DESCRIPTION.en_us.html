<p>Elsie is inspired by feminine energy. This new typeface was created to
celebrate the world of women, glamor and fashion. It combines the
strength of Bodoni with the softness of italics. Sensitive,
attractive, full of personality, innovative and subtle with both
classic and new design features. I aimed to add expressive features to
the letters, providing nuances that make this a unique vision of
Bodoni type.</p>

<p>There are two Elsie families, a

family and this
Swash Caps
family, each with a regular weight and a black weight suitable for large display usage.</p>
