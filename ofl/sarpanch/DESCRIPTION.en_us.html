<p>Sarpanch is an Open Source typeface supporting both the Devanagari and the Latin scripts, designed for large size  usage. It bears some similarity to ITF’s Akhand family, but Sarpanch features letterforms with more stroke contrast, squarer proportions and a structure that appears more visually simple. Six fonts in this family have been produced so far, ranging from Regular to Black. As weight increases along the family’s axis, the vertical strokes become thicker. However, the typeface’s horizontal strokes retain the same thickness across each weight. Therefore, while the Regular weight of the family is almost monolinear, the black weight is very high-contrast.</p>

<p>The Regular, Medium and Semibold fonts are recommended for use in long headlines, while Bold, Heavy and Black are intended primarily for setting one or two words. At display sizes, Sarpanch works equally well on screen or in print. Each font contains 1,035 glyphs and offers full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written in the Devanagari and Latin scripts.</p>

<p>The simplified graphic language of Sarpanch has precedence in many typefaces designed during the mid-20th century for the Latin script, including Aachen, Bank Gothic or Eurostile. When mixing Sarpanch with other typefaces, questions such as serif or sans serif are less relevant than the amount of stroke contrast present in the other font, or whether its stroke endings terminate in similar ways.</p>

<p>Manushi Parikh designed the family at ITF in 2014. Sarpanch is an excellent choice for use in advertising or for news tickers on television screens (breaking news, etc.). In Hindi, the word Sarpanch means ‘the head of a village’.</p>
