FONTLOG for the Gelasio font

This file provides detailed information on 
Gelasio Font Software. This information should be 
distributed along with the Gelasio font and any 
derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Gelasio is a general purpose screen oriented text 
face based on the Romain du Roi style cold metal 
type seen in a "OEuvres de Jean Racine" printed in 
1789. This pre-Baskerville style is sometimes called 
Reale or Transitional style. This and and a large 
x height offer a nobel, cheerful and simple feeling 
hence the name Gelasio.

Gelasio is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, 
and could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2: Easern Europe, Turkish, 
Macintosh Character Set.

There are four source files for each style:

1. Gelasio-Style.vfb Original Source Files with 
   contour overlaps

2. Gelasio-Style-OTF.sfd Merged contours and 
   optimized file corresponding to the OTF file

3. Gelasio-Style-TTF.sfd TrueType outlines with 
   hinting adjustments corresponding to the TTF file

4. Gelasio-Style.otf PostScript outlines OTF-CFF font.
