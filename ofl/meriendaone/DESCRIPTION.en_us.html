<p>'Merienda' is a Spanish term for "afternoon snack", and this pleasant time of the day was worth its own typography.</p> <p>Merienda has soft shapes, is slightly condensed, and has a rhythm which is an invitation to read short pieces of text. It is ideal for headlines which call for height, as its strokes resemble those of a brush and deliver freshness and a dynamic touch in the development of words.</p> <p>A script type by Eduardo Tunni, and more documentation can be found at <a href="http://www.tipo.net.ar">www.tipo.net.ar</a></p>
