<p>Alef is an open source multiscript webfont that supports both Latin and Hebrew. Alef was born to the screen and designed to the pixel in an attempt to extend the pallet of Hebrew fonts available for web design and especially to challenge the only default - "Arial".</p>

<p>This is the Latin subset, only. The full multi-script version is available at <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/earlyaccess">Google Fonts Early Access</a>.</p>
