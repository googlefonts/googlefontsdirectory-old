<p>Titillium is born inside the Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino as a
didactic project Course Type design of the Master of Visual Design Campi
Visivi.</p>

<p>The aim of the project is the creation of a collective fonts released under
OFL. Each academic year, a dozen of students are working on the project,
developing and solving problems. The type designers interested in the
amendment or revision of Titillium are invited to cooperate or develop their
own variants of the character according to the terms specified in the license.
We also ask all graphic designers who use Titillium in their projects to send
us some examples

of the typeface family in use, in order to prepare a case histories database.</p>

<p>Three years after the birth of Titillium the project is still evolving,
even we donâ€™t know what it will become in the future.</p>
