			Andika ("Write!" in Swahili) is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font
      designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of
      beginning readers. The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms
      that will not be easily confused with one another.
      
      A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching
      people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than some
      serif fonts can be. For years, literacy workers have had to make do
      with fonts that were available but not really suitable for beginning
      readers and writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to
      tediously cobble together letters from a variety of fonts in order to
      get the all of characters they need for their particular language
      project, resulting in confusing and unattractive publications. Andika
      addresses those issues.
      
      After receiving many insightful comments on the Design Review and Basic
      fonts, we have refined Andika's final letterforms, with alternate shapes
      still available for some characters. 
      
      With the SIL TypeTuner utility (see http://scripts.sil.org/TypeTuner),
      you can select which alternates to use as Andika's default letterforms.
      
      This font now contains the same character set as Charis SIL and
      Doulos SIL.
      
      One font from this typeface family is included in this release:
      
           * Andika Regular
      
      Work is ongoing to provide italic, bold and bold-italic weights.
      
      Features
      --------
      
      Andika supports all of the smart font features that the Doulos SIL
      font supports. It also contains features specific to Andika. 
      These are:
         Capital Q alternate
         Lower case j serif alternate
         Lower case q alternate
         No-tail t and y alternates
         Numeral 0 1 4 6 7 9 alternates
         Tail i and l alternates
      
      More detail on features can be seen at
      http://scripts.sil.org/SILUnicodeRF_Features.

      -----------------------------------------------------------
      
      PREAMBLE
      The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
      development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
      efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
      open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
      with others.
      
      The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
      redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
      fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
      redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
      names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
      however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
      requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
      to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
