<p>Tagoni is a humanist sans serif conceived to be a web 
font with nice legibility at normal text sizes. Originally 
based on grid fitting shapes it became a multi-purpose typeface 
with low contrast, open counter forms, wide proportions and 
a touch of freshness.</p>

<p>Tagoni is a reworking of 
<a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Telex">Telex</a>
into a family.</p>
