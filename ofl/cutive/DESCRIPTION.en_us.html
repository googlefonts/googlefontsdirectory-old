<p>The design of Cutive is based on a number of classic typewriter typefaces, in particular the faces of IBM's 'Executive', and the older 'Smith-Premier'.  In Cutive these old faces re-emerge as a webfont that is useful for adding character to body texts as well as in larger sizes for headlines and other display uses.</p> <p>To contribute to the project see <a href="https://github.com/vernnobile/CutiveFont/tree/master/src">Cutive on GitHub</a>.</p>
