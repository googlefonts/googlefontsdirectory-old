<p>"Supermercado One is a low contrast semi geometric typeface inspired by naive industrial letters. Supermercado One is not a typical mechanical sans because it incorporates unexpected swashes, especially in its capitals. Supermercado One is surprisingly versatile: it is certainly quite distinctive when set at larges sizes but it can also work at fairly small sizes and in blocks of text.</p>
