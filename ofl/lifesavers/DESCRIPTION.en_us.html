<p>Do you remember the "Life Savers" candies adds from the 50s? That was atime when Ad Agencies actually hired Lettering Artist for they advertisingtext. Before the advent of Photo Typesetting, all the text was beautifullydrawn by hand.</p><p>We are going to put some love to work and bring back the Life Savershand-lettered Typewritter/Stymie mix. Probably drawn originally by FrazierPurdy for the Sam Marsh Studio.</p>
