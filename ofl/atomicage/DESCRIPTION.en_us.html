<p>Atomic Age was inspired by 1950s era connected scripts seen on nameplates of American cars. Atomic Age looses the connection but keeps the spirit of these letters to make a highly legible somewhat mechanical looking font. Atomic Age is usable from very small sizes all the way up to large display sizes.</p>
