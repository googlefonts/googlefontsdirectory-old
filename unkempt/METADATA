description: <p>unkempt /ˌənˈkem(p)t/  adj. <br />\
  1. lacking in order, neatness, and often cleanliness. \
  Font designer Squid may be a bit disorderly but that \
  didn't keep him from hand-lettering this off-kilter \
  gem just for you.  Unkempt is definitely different \
  than your traditional regimented font but, it's \
  hardly dirty! In fact, you can download it in a \
  nifty little package that's never been touched by \
  human hands. And it's fun! Get it!</p>
