description: <p>&quot;Yanone Kaffeesatz&quot; \
was first published in 2004 and is Yanone’s first ever finished typeface. \
Its Bold is reminiscent of 1920s coffee house typography, while the \
rather thin fonts bridge the gap to present times. Lacking self confidence \
and knowledge about the type scene, Yanone decided to publish the family \
for free under a \
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/de/deed.en">Creative \
Commons License</a>. \
A decision that should turn out one of the best he ever made. It has \
been downloaded over 100,000 times to date, \
and you can witness Kaffeesatz use on German fresh-water gyms, Dubai \
mall promos and New Zealand McDonalds ads. And of course on coffee \
and foodstuff packaging and café design around the globe.</p> \
<p>In 2009 he reworked \
much of the typeface and it got published in FontShop’s \
<a href="http://www.fontfont.com/index.ep?aid=28">FontFont Library</a> \
under the new name \
<a href="http://www.yanone.de/typedesign/kava/">FF Kava</a>. \
 You can read more about \
it in an extensive article by Yves Peters on \
