description: <p>Diplomata started several years ago when a \
  friend in the printing industry who had an old metal \
  typeface wanted it to be digitalized for offset printing. \
  He brought everything the original type offered as a start, \
  a set of upper case characters, numbers, and some \
  punctuation marks.</p> \
  <p>But what he brought in printed form was not enough \
  to meet his needs, and letterforms that did not exist \
  had to be created. It is a fine job to reinterpret a \
  design, to make decisions on what already exists and \
  also have in mind the changes needed for the new \
  technological context where Diplomata will be used.</p> \
  <p>Its style, similar to Bodoni, has a remarkable degree \
  of horizontal expansion; a weight which indicates \
  verticality; areas between serif and stem softened \
  by a curve connecting them, and the light in the main \
  stroke of each glyph is a detail that lightens up and \
  gives prominence to Diplomata. It is a distinct typeface, \
  ideal for composing headlines and small prestigious \
  pieces of text.</p> <p>To improve and expand the use \
  of Diplomata, it was necessary to create small caps and \
  <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Diplomata+SC">a \
  lower case</a>, which ended up constituting this \
  family that has two variables today.</p> \
