description: <p>The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection \
  is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand \
  lettering and calligraphy in the United States. \
  From the early 1930s through World War II, there \
  were about 200 professional hand letterers working \
  in New York City alone. This occupation saw its \
  demise with the advent of photo lettering, and \
  after digital typography it became virtually extinct. \
  The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were \
  assembled and created - by collecting different \
  signatures and then building complete alphabets \
  from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. \
  Because the set of constructed designs looked \
  nothing like the original signatures, fictitious \
  names were assigned to the new script typefaces. \
  The typeface styles were then showcased in \
  Higgins Ink catalogs.</p> \
  <p>Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein \
  scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital \
  versions, reflecting the demands of today’s \
  designer. Extreme care has been taken to render \
  the original scripts authentically, keeping the \
  fictitious names originally assigned to them by \
  Bluemlein.</p>
