# TODO: Check that this font is really published with a dual license as the description currently says. And change the description if this is not the case: the metadata of the sources also needs checking and correcting.
# Dual licensing fonts is not a best practise and very likely to introduce confusion and problems. Especially between software-oriented licenses and content-oriented licenses.
# Is this font directory really going to accept CC-licensed fonts even if CC discourages the use of CC for software? Not a good idea at all.

# You seriously need to reconsider this.

description: <p>The icons in this dingbat font were \
  originally designed for the Franklin Street \
  WordPress theme.</p> \
  <p>They are intended to be minimal renderings yet \
  unique in form. Alternatives for several \
  marks have been added for greater choice \
  in style.</p> \
  <p>One main goal for these icons were to \
  have them maintain high legibility over \
  a large scale range. Non-font format versions \
  are available from the \
  <a href="http://somerandomdude.com/projects/iconic/">Iconic \
  homepage</a>. Most of the icons \
  in this set will work from 8×8 pixels\
  to however large you need to go. \
  Flexibility is a beautiful thing, \
  isn’t it?</p> \
  <p>This set is currently licensed under \
  the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike \
  3.0 license and the SIL OFL v1.1. \
  While I designed these icons specifically \
  for myself, I want them to be everyone’s \
  icons now. You can always make your \
  own with the SVG originals.</p>
