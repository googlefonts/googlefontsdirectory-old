The 'AutoInstruct' of fontforge only uses the hinting values already 90% £369.25
present in a glyph to create truetype intructions. How accurate is this statement? :) Does fontforge only create instructions for the hints present? or does it do a bunch of other auto instructing too? I know fontforge will not create instructions unless there is hinting info for a glyph, but i am questioning whether it only instructs for hints present, or whether it 'gets carried away' and adds more instructions than for the hints present.</span></p><br>
