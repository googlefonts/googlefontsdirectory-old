FONTLOG for the Passero One font

This file provides detailed information on Passero One
Font Software. This information should be distributed 
along with the Passero One font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Passero One is an innovative low contrast sans serif type. 
Despite having an utterly distinctive voice it remains 
remarkably legible and versatile. Perhaps this is because 
of the way Passero One gently echos old style text 
letterforms. Passero One will work best from medium 
text sizes through large display sizes.

Passero One is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be 
expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode 
ranges: Latin-1
