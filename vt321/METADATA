# 2011-02-03 TODO originaldesigner: Who made the VT321 font?

approved: true
description: <p>This font was created from the \
  glyphs of the DEC VT320 text terminal, which \
  I used in college, and for which I have \
  retained an unaccountable nostalgia.</p> \
  <p>I used a variety of tools, including Gimp, \
  Python/PIL, and of course, FontForge. \
  The VT320 glyphs were designed with a \
  nonrectangular pixel aspect ratio to \
  fit the way the terminal scanned the \
  CRT, so I had Python munge the locations \
  and draw the proper pixels into a 1:1 \
  pixel grid as a monochrome PNG, which I \
  then had FontForge autoscan into outlines.</p> \
  <p>I have attempted to support most of the \
  glyphs available on the VT320, but that \
  is a limited set to begin with, so please \
  don't be disappointed that I haven't \
  supported Esperanto or Riograndenser \
  Hunsr√ºckisch or whatever.</p> \
  <p>There is also a later version called \
  "VT323" that I personally prefer over \
  VT321 for actual command-line work \
  in a terminal window.</p>
