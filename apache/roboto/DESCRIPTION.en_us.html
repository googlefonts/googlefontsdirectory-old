<p>Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open
curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,
Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settle in to their natural
width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in
humanist and serif types.</p>

<p>This is the normal family, which can be used alongside the
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Condensed">Roboto Condensed</a> family and the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Slab">Roboto Slab</a> family.</p>

<p><b>Updated July 31 2013:</b> Hinting has been improved and a fix made to ỡ, the Vietnamese 'o with horn and tilde' character. If you have installed the fonts on your computer, please download them again and re-install.</p>
