<p>When text is rendered by a program, sometimes there will be characters in the text that can not be displayed, because no font is available to the program that supports them. When this occurs, small boxes are shown to represent the characters. We call those small boxes "tofu," and we want to remove tofu from the Web.</p>

<p>The Noto font families will support all characters in Unicode, and this is the Serif Latin, Greek and Cyrillic family. It has Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic styles and is hinted, so it will render well on older computers. It is derived from Droid, and like Droid it has a sister serif family, <a href="//www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Noto+Sans">Noto Sans</a>.</p>

<p>Noto fonts for many other languages are available as web fonts from the <a href="//www.google.com/webfonts/earlyaccess">Google Web Fonts Early Access</a> page.</p>

<p>Noto fonts are intended to be visual harmonious across multiple languages, with compatible heights and stroke thicknesses. The Noto project homepage is <a
