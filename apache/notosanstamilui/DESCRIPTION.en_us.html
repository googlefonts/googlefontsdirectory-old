<p>When text is rendered by a program, sometimes there will be characters in the text that can not be displayed, because no font that supports them is available to the program. When this occurs, small boxes are shown to represent the characters. We call those small boxes &#8220;tofu,&#8221; and we want to remove tofu from the Web. This is how the Noto font families got their name.</p>

<p>The Noto font families will support all characters in Unicode, and this is the Sans Tamil UI family. The design of Noto UI fonts are adjusted to be more vertically compact, a refinement made for user interface typography; you may wish to compare them with the normal Noto Sans Tamil fonts. It has Regular and Bold styles and is hinted, so it will render well on older computers.</p>

<p>Noto fonts are intended to be visually harmonious across multiple languages, with compatible heights and stroke thicknesses. The Noto project homepage is <a
