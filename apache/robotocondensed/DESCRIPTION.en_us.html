<p>How do we make Android enchanting? We start at the beginning with the words.
Meet Roboto. It’s a totally new typeface for Android. Modern, yet
approachable, and it was built from scratch for high definition, paper density
displays.</p>

<p>Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
largely geometric. At the same time, the font’s sweeping semi-circular curves
give it a cheerful demeanor.</p>

<p>This is the Condensed family, which can be used alongside the normal
<a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Roboto+Condensed">Roboto</a> family.</p>
