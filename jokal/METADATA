description: <p>In the interest of pushing the web forward, \
  Bold Perspective is providing free @font-face licensing \
  so you can use Jokal on your website, both in \
  non-commercial and commercial ventures.</p> \
  <p>Our goal in the beginning was to create a font \
  that felt like it was hand made and evoked a very \
  personal, human feel. We wanted to saturate every \
  letter of Jokal with a unique character. To accomplish \
  this, we sketched every single letter starting with \
  pencil, paper, and a little bit of imagination.</p> \
  <p>Once the drafts were complete, letter sketches \
  were brought into Illustrator. While guides and a \
  grid were used to promote consistency throughout \
  the font, the irregulaties of the pencil sketches \
  were intentially kept to preveserve unique traits \
  of Jokal that were imparted by the pencil.</p>
