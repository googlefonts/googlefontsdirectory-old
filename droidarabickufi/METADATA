description: <p>Droid Arabic Kufi is an Arabic type designed for \
  use in Google™ products such as Google ChromeOS™ and Android™. \
  Designed to complement the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic provided \
  in the Droid Sans family, the Arabic matches the color, \
  alignment and design detail of the Droid Sans allowing them to \
  be used together for multi-lingual typesetting. This Kufi style \
  is optimized for reading Arabic script on screen. The large \
  ‘loop height’ and ‘tooth height’ help prevent readers from \
  having to zoom web pages to a larger size in order to read them. \
  The traditional Kufi forms are softened for less formal \
  documents such as periodicals and journals. The letterforms \
  structures are based on the calligraphic grammatical rules of \
  the Kufi writing style while drawn with a contemporary feel.</p>
