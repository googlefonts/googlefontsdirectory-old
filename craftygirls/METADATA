description: <p>Inspired by crochet hooks, yarn, \
  grandma's button box, thread, glitter and crafty \
  girls hands everywhere! This delightfully playful \
  casual handwriting script font was hand drawn by \
  the Tart Workshop's own resident lettering artist \
  and crafty guru Crystal Kluge and makes the \
  perfect compliment to all your projects! Use \
  it in your very best creative projects, then \
  blog about them in the same font!</p>
