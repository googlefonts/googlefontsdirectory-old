bio: <p>When I am not working on my own type \
  projects I am probably doing scientific \
  experiments with type, or reading, speaking \
  or writing about type. The science of letter \
  recognition - as well as its abscence which \
  for some reason is called "crowding" is \
  important to me.</p> \
  <p>I came to this interest through research \
  into the ways in which letterforms have \
  historically been adjusted to fit in the \
  context of each other. It seemed like this \
  kind of contextual shaping of letters might \
  be applied to making better text types. \
  Research into this eventually led me to \
  learn how to carve letters in stone.</p> \
  <p>I am also keenly interested in the \
  ways in which types, and especially type \
  for screens can harness variation in style \
  to make complex information easier to use \
  by making it easier to understand. This \
  work is particularly important for users \
  of non Latin scripts because type for \
  these scripts tends to be available in \
  far fewer styles.</p> \
  <p>I have a MA in type design from the \
  program at Reading University (UK).</p>
