bio: <p>Yanone, born Jan \
  Gerner in 1982 as the second son of a mechanical engineer and an industry \
  architect in Dresden, German Democratic Republic, is a young graphic \
  and type designer, multimedia artist, disc jockey and sound system operator. \
  After spending nine years of his childhood and early youth in Addis \
  Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, he returned to unified Germany to finish \
  his secondary education. His father sat him down at the computer to \
  teach him the programming language Pascal at 14, which sparked his wish \
  to become an information scientist. Designing his secondary school graduate \
  yearbook in 2000 and early attempts of web design got him interested \
  in graphic design in general, and type design in specific was soon to \
  follow.</p> \
  <p>He commenced studies \
  of Information Technology at the Bauhaus-University in Weimar in 2002, \
  and switched to Visual Communications two years later. Since type design \
  has never officially been a curriculum in Weimar, a close friend gave \
  him the initial toolset and feeling for designing individual letters \
  and combinations thereof. His seven university years also brought him \
  to Amman, Jordan for an internship at Amman-based design and branding \
  office <i>SYNTAX</i> and to Berlin for an internship at <i>FontShop \
  International</i>. There he learned the technical skills necessary to \
  produce high quality typefaces which cemented his ongoing development \
  as a type designer and technician.</p> \
  <p>He completed his \
  studies in Weimar in 2009 with a rather extensive type design project. \
  Ahmad Humeid, former speaker at <i>Typo Berlin</i> and CEO of <i>SYNTAX</i>, \
  invited him again to Jordan to take part in their latest branding project \
  for Greater Amman Municipality, capital of Jordan. Out came a family \
  of 22 fonts, of Arabic and Latin alphabet, upright and cursive, Sans \
  and Serif for the branding of Amman. The typeface includes the first \
  ever digital real italic as a companion to the upright script. His graduation \
  typeface can be spotted all over Amman by now and will be published \
  as <i>FF Amman</i> in the <i>FontFont</i> library of <i>FontShop</i> \
  in 2010.</p> \
