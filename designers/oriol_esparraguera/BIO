bio: <p>Oriol Esparraguera was born in Girona (Catalonia, \
  Spain) in April, 1982.</p> \
  <p>In 2000 I began studying graphic design at Olot, but \
  ended up specialising in artistic photography, where I began \
  to browse and experiment with different techniques for both \
  analog and digital images. As the same time, \
  I started to work as a freelance graphic designer for local \
  businesses.</p> \
  <p>In 2003, along with several friends, I created "labanderia" \
  ("The Laundry"), a joint project to experiment with textiles; \
  it was like a creativity workshop that used clothing as a \
  canvas. To develop more generic projects, we created Parq.ink, \
  a multidisciplinary group that was designed to give free rein \
  to our imaginations to do anything.</p> \
  <p>In 2007 I began a new design career, and developed a \
  great appreciation not only for graphic design, but also \
  for type design.</p> \
  <p>I have been self-taught since then, and in 2008 I worked \
  in the design studio "fromzero" in Banyoles (also in \
  Catalonia.)</p> \
  <p>I graduated in 2011, working as a freelance designer \
  and designing typefaces in my spare time.</p>
