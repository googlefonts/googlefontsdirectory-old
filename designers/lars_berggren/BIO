bio: <p>Lars lives in the suburbs of Malm in the \
  southernmost part of Sweden. Malm is an international, \
  dynamic and growing part of the country with a close \
  relation to the capitol of Denmark and has a very \
  diverse population. As you would expect, this has \
  spawned the usual expressions of modern urban culture.</p> \
  <p>Lars has grown up and worked as a graphic \
  designer, both online and with print, for more \
  than a decade in this environment during a time \
  of massive change and development which naturally \
  has influenced his expression as a typographer \
  and graphic designer.</p> \
  <p>At the moment Lars is working as a graphic \
  design teacher at an upper secondary school, \
  trying to teach the kids some of the many \
  skills needed in the ever changing profession \
  of graphic design.</p>
