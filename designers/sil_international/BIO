bio: <p>SIL International is a faith-based nonprofit \
  organization committed to serving language communities \
  worldwide as they build capacity for sustainable \
  language development. SIL does this primarily \
  through research, translation, training and materials \
  development. SIL partners with host governments, NGOs \
  (nongovernment organizations), universities, churches \
  and the local people themselves to promote linguistic \
  research, language development, literacy, multilingual \
  education, translation and other educational and \
  research projects of practical, social and moral value. \
  SIL's linguistic investigation exceeds 2,590 languages \
  spoken by over 1.7 billion people in nearly 100 \
  countries. The organization makes its services available \
  to all, without regard to religious belief, political \
  ideology, gender, race or ethnolinguistic  \
  background.</p> \
  <p>SIL's Non-Roman Script Initiative (NRSI) provides \
  assistance, research and development for SIL International \
  and its partners to support the use of non-Roman and \
  complex scripts in language development. The NRSI's \
  vision is that language communities are effectively \
  using their preferred writing system on computers \
  without technical barriers.</p>
