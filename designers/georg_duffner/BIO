bio: <p>Georg Duffner was born in Austria in \
  1980. He studied romance languages and linguistics \
  in Vienna, where he is living. His general interest \
  in languages, writing systems, calligraphy and \
  typography paired with his opensource-enthusiasm \
  led him to learn about Opentype and how to draw \
  BÃ©zier curves so he can make fonts for the \
  community.</p>
