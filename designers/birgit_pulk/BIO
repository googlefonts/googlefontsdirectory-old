bio: <p>I am an Estonian graphic designer, mostly \
  interested in typography. I have been studying \
  in Estonian Academy of Arts from 2008-2011.</p>
  <p>Interest in typography began in elementary \
  school with an opportunity to participate in \
  calligraphy classes. During 5 years I learned \
  blackletter, modern calligraphy and I also \
  created some of my own typefaces. I liked \
  calligraphy because the crafting and finding \
  the accuracy in letters was quite an interesting \
  challenge.</p> \
  <p>Later, already in university it was possible \
  to develop these basic skills by using new \
  alternative tools to make fonts: for example \
  computers, tablet etc. That gave us the \
  opportunity to use our fonts more often and \
  our work didn't stay only on paper.</p>
