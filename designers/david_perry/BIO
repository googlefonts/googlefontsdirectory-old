bio: <p>I was trained as a classicist, with a Bachelors degree from Williams College in Massachusetts \
  and a Master of Arts in Teaching from the University of Massachusetts/Amherst. The original \
  IBM PC was introduced not long after I began teaching Latin for a living. I bought one and \
  asked what I thought would be a simple question: how could I produce vowels with macra over \
  them ( ā ē ī ō ū ) for use in the materials I created for my students? As it turned out, this was \
  not at all simple. I had to learn how to modify fonts designed for an HP LaserJet (a separate \
  font file for each point size!), fool the operating system by replacing umlauts with macra, and \
  then create customized printer drivers for Word (ugh—I still remember what a pain that was). I \
  was also pursuing a Ph.D., which required Greek as well as Latin. I won’t even talk about the \
  situation with Greek at the time, except to say that there were multiple solutions, all incompatible \
  with each other. But I got really interested in learning how to get personal computers to work \
  with languages other than English, and in particular with specialized characters needed by \
  scholars.</p> \
  <p>Things got a lot better with TrueType fonts and Unicode. In the mid-1990s, I began learning \
  about Unicode and quickly came to believe that it was the way of the future. I wanted to \
  experiment with using existing Unicode characters and adding missing ones needed by classicists \
  and medievalists. I was unable to find a font with an appropriate design that I could legally \
  modify and redistribute to colleagues, so I started learning about type design and the mechanics \
  of font creation. I’ve always loved books, so this was not a difficult leap to make. That was the \
  genesis of Cardo.</p> \
  <p>Over the years I have worked on font and character encoding issues with various scholarly \
  projects, notably the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae and the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative. \
  My research also lead to proposals for some characters needed by Latin epigraphers that were \
  missing from Unicode. These characters are now enshrined in the Standard. I have written \
  Document Preparation for Classical Languages (second edition 2010), a book written from the \
  perspective of scholars that explains Unicode, OpenType, and how to locate and use fonts with \
  specialized characters to produce documents in Greek, Latin, Hebrew and other languages. I \
  am also co-author of Book III of the Latin textbook series Ecce Romani, published by Pearson \
  Prentice Hall.</p>
