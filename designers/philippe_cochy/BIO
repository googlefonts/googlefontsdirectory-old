bio: <p>I think a very long time (!) that a \
  computer is a great way to let play \
  its neurons. Internet and the Open Source \
  give to my enthusiasm it's \
  full dimension. I think that these are \
  determinants  vectors in freedom \
  of expression and I defend them vigorously. \
  I am a type designer.</p>
