bio: <p>I enjoy creative arts of every kind including theater, photography, \
  and graphic design.  After graduating with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Liberal \
  Studies, I became a stay-at-home mom.   Creating fonts allowed me to use my \
  love of art in a new way while I was at home with my daughters.</p>\
  <p>I am passionate about God, orphan care, and sustainable development.  \
  I enjoy studying languages in my spare time.  I live in sunny Florida with \
  my husband and 2 daughters.</p>
