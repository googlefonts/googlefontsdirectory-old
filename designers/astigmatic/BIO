bio: <p>In 1873, the strange and fantastic story began. Nearly two centuries later, <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/person/Brian_J._Bonislawsky/">Brian J. Bonislawsky</a> was born, and carrying on a mix of the the footsteps his ancestors before him took, he picked up the the traditions and founded the Astigmatic One Eye Foundry, which later expanded to become the Astigmatic One Eye Typographic Institute.</p><p>Since its founding Astigmatic has worked with dozens of designers, helping them forge their own foundries as well as helping to increase the quality of type created by Astigmatic and these other foundries. Astigmatic strives to continually increase its range of typographic scope; taking on expeditions to revive old typestyles, unearth long lost typefaces, forge new styles yet unseen, and begin to develop more comprehensive language typestyles of the WGL4 set size which includes Greek and Cyrillic extensions.</p><p>If you are looking for a wide variety of typographic influence and style, the Astigmatic One Eye Institute is your source for type.</p>
