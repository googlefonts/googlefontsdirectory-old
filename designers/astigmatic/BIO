bio: <p>You will find various biographies \
  for Astigmatic on the web, some true, \
  some a bit more fantastic in nature, but \
  the truth of it all is that Brian \
  J. Bonislawsky has loved lettering since \
  his first Speedball lettering book in \
  Elementary School through today.</p> \
  <p>Since its founding, Astigmatic has \
  worked with dozens of designers, and \
  is continually striving to increase \
  its range of typographic scope; taking \
  on expeditions to revive old typestyles \
  and to forge new styles yet unseen.</p> \
  <p>If you are looking for a wide \
  variety of typographic influence and \
  style, the Astigmatic One Eye \
  Institute is your source for type.</p>
