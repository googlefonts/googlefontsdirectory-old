bio: <p>I was born in 1972 in Kampuchea Krom (in South Vietnam), a region where over one million \
people speak Khmer and maintain their own unique and indigenous culture.  I graduated from the \
Ho Chi Minh City University of Law in South Vietnam, but became interested in the Khmer language \
and typography, and in particular complex scripts. I came to work in Cambodia as webmaster and \
graphic designer in 2002.</p>\
<p>I started to study type design by myself in the mid-1990s, and I created a Khmer Unicode font \
in 2001. I learned about OpenType and hinting for the creation of high quality fonts at Microsoft \
in Seattle in August 2002.</p>\
<p>The first open source font that I created was the KhmerOS (Khmer OpenSource) font, first \
released as a free download for MS Windows and Office users in 2003.  The project took on the \
name of the font (www.khmeros.info).</p>\
<p>Since, the KhmerOS fonts have been updated to support Windows, Linux, Adobe's products and \
more recently Mac OS X (after adding both OpenType and AAT support).</p>
<p>I have worked as webmaster, journalist and am now working as the web assistant of Radio Free \
Asia (www.rfa.org).  On occasion I teach font design to Cambodian and Lao students and other \
people visiting Cambodia. I have also studied font design in Lao and helped the Lao government \
to create a national standard font in 2005.</p>\
<p>On my blog, I share my experiences and tips in using computers and in using Khmer Unicode \
fonts on Mac OS X, Adobe's products and on mobile phones: http://khmertype.blogspot.com/</p>
