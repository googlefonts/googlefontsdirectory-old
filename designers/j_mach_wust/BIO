bio: <p>J. 'mach' wust lives in Switzerland. His main interests are scripts of \
  all kinds, especially their linguistic aspects. He came to type design \
  because he noticed that the powerful capabilities provided by Unicode and \
  smart font technologies were largely ignored.</p><p>The first font related \
  project by j. 'mach' wust is the \
  <a href="http://freetengwar.sourceforge.net/">Free Tengwar Font Project</a>. \
  It combines Unicode compatibility with smart font technologies.</p>\
  <p>The second font related project by j. 'mach' wust is the \
  <a href="http://unifraktur.sourceforge.net/">Unifraktur</a> project. He \
  created it because most fraktur fonts he could find outrightly violated the \
  Unicode standard by using private letter assignments, and none used smart \
  font technologies for displaying the ligatures.</p>
