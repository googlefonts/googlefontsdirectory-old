bio: <p>Hacker culture was irresistible to me, growing up in the \
  suburban arcadia of south west England in the 1990s. But \
  being "good with computers" pointed towards the life depicted \
  in Fight Club, so in high school I dropped maths and physics \
  for contemporary art and socio-linguistics.</p> \
  <p>Combining my interests in art and computers eventually \
  led me to the BA Interaction Design programme at Ravensbourne \
  College in London. By the time I graduated in 2006, I was \
  fascinated with the potential of software freedom for \
  graphic design and typography. I decided to free fonts.</p> \
  <p>I attended the University of Reading's \
  <a href="http://www.typefacedesign.org">MA Typeface \
  Design</a> programme and graduated in 2009. In my thesis I \
  related the history of the software freedom movement \
  to key concepts in type design. My student project \
  "Cantarell" was included in the launch of \
  <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Google Web \
  Fonts</a> and chosen as the default User Interface \
  font for <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>.</p> \
  <p>In 2011 I am consulting for Google Web Fonts, \
  traveling widely thanks to the \
  <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org">CouchSurfing</a> \
  project, and running workshops on typeface design \
  with free software along the way.</p> \
  <p>I believe that anyone can learn to draw, and \
  <a href="http://www.transitionnetwork.org">Transition \
  Towns</a> is really important.</p>
