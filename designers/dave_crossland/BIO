bio: <p>I am a professional systems administrator, graphic designer and public speaker.</p><p>Hacker culture was irresistible to me, growing up in the suburban arcadia of south west England in the 1990s. But "being good with computers" pointed towards a future that looked a lot like Office Space, so in high school I dropped maths and physics for contemporary art and socio-linguistics.</p><p>Combining my interests in art and computers eventually led me to the BA Interaction Design programme at Ravensbourne College, London. By the time I graduated with First class honours in 2006, I had become fascinated with the potential of free software for graphic design and typography.</p><p>Free software was awesome, but <em>where were the fonts?</em> I decided to spend the next 10 years sorting that out.</p><p>In 2009 I graduated from the University of Reading's <a href="http://www.typefacedesign.org">MA Typeface Design</a> programme. Today I'm traveling widely, thanks to the <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org">CouchSurfing</a> project, and running <a href="http://understandingfonts.com">workshops on typeface design</a> with free software along the way.</p><p>I also happen to believe that anyone can learn to draw, and <a href="http://www.transitionnetwork.org">Transition Towns</a> is really important.</p>
