bio: <p>Hacker culture was irresistible to me, growing \
  up in the suburban arcadia of south west England in \
  the 1990s. But being "good with computers" pointed \
  towards a life depicted in Office Space (or Fight \
  Club) so in high school I dropped maths and physics \
  for contemporary art and socio-linguistics.</p> \
  <p>Combining my interests in art and computers \
  eventually led me to the BA Interaction Design \
  programme at Ravensbourne College, London. By the \
  time I graduated in 2006 I was fascinated with \
  the potential of software freedom for graphic \
  design and typography. I decided to free fonts \
  for fun and profit.</p> \
  <p>In 2009 I graduated from the University of \
  Reading's <a href="http://www.typefacedesign.org">MA \
  Typeface Design</a> programme and my student \
  project Cantarell was chosen for the launch of \
  <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Google Web \
  Fonts</a> and became the default User Interface font \
  for <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>.</p> \
  <p>In 2011 I am consulting for Google on the \
  Web Fonts project, traveling widely thanks to the \
  <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org">CouchSurfing</a> \
  project, and running \
  <a href="http://understandingfonts.com">workshops on \
  typeface design</a> with free software along the \
  way.</p><p>I believe that anyone can \
  learn to draw, and \
  <a href="http://www.transitionnetwork.org">Transition \
  Towns</a> is really important.</p>
