bio: <p>I started out as a graphic designer and illustrator in 1976. During \
  the early part of my career I worked as an art director on a number of \
  magazines and other publications including Metropolis (a Minneapolis weekly, \
  1977), Machete (a Minneapolis broadsheet, 1978-80), TWA Ambassador (an \
  inflight magazine, 1979-81), Minnesota Monthly (Minnesota Public Radio's \
  regional magazine, 1979-85), and the Utne Reader (1984-88).</p>\
  <p>I was head designer and art director for Minnesota Public Radio (1981-85) \
  and an art director for its sister company, Rivertown Trading Company \
  (1992-2000). During that time, I designed over 200 audio packages, including \
  most of Garrison Keillor's, along with several hundred products (t-shirts, \
  mugs, rugs, watches, etc.) for the Wireless, Signals, and other mail order \
  catalogs.</p>\
  <p>I frequently did lettering as part of design projects I worked on. This \
  was always my favorite part, so in 2000 I opened my own shop specializing in \
  lettering and typography.</p>\
  <p>I've also been interested in typeface design since my college days. I \
  started licensing fonts to FontHaus in 1992, and since starting my new \
  business, stepped up my efforts in developing original typefaces. I now have \
  more than 100 fonts on the market with many more to come.</p>\
