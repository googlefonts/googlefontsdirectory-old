bio: <p>I've been creating websites since 1999. If you are looking for a kick-ass php programmer, you \
  should check my portfolio site (in Spanish). Now, I'm also loving Typography and Font \
  Development. That's why I also started a blog about fonts and released my first typeface, \
  called "<a href="http://www.impallari.com/lobster" title="Impallari.com">The Lobster Font</a>"</p>
