bio: <p>Igino Marini began the digitization of the Fell Types in 2000. Three books were used as source:</p> \
<ul> \
<li>Stanley Morison: “THE ROMAN ITALIC & BLACK LETTER bequeathed to University of Oxford by \
Dr. JOHN FELL,” Oxford University Press, 1951 \
<li>Stanley Morison: “JOHN FELL The University Press and the ‘Fell’ Types,” Oxford University Press, 1967 \
<li>Horace Hart: “Notes on a Century of Typography at the University Press Oxford, 1693-1794,” Oxford, \
The Clarendon Press, 1970 \
</ul> \
<p>The first and second are printed using the original type on modern paper. Most of the samples are  \
taken from them. The third is a facsimile from the original of 1900, edited by Harry Carter. Only a few \
samples for the “De Walpergen Pica” were taken from it. To avoid altering the original cut, particularly \
for glyphs that were “ink poor,” many images were digitized for each glyph and the best examples used. \
In his “The Fell Types–What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968), \
Harry Carter said: &quot;Technical imperfection is undoubtedly part of the character of ‘Fell’ in print. \
The pieces of type differ in height to an extent that horrifies a type-founder and tries the patience \ 
of a machine manager; their faces are not horizontal, many are not struck at the correct angle with the \
vertical. By employing modern techniques it would be possible to put these things right, but so far \
nobody dares propose it; too much of the evident difference between Fell and other types would be lost&quot;.</p> \
<p>Glyphs not found in the source materials were created and added to the original set, which now covers \
Western, Central Europe, Baltic and Turkish languages. Particular care has been taken to achieve a \
good fitting quality using the 2007 version of the autospacing and autokerning tool \
<a href="http://ikern.com">iKern</a>, developed by the same author.</p>
