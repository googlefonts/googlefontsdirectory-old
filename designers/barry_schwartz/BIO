bio: <p>Barry Schwartz, born in 1961, grew \
  up primarily in Kendall Park, New Jersey, \
  USA. As a teenager reading library books he \
  discovered the typeface Electra and thus \
  the existence of typefaces.</p> \
  <p>While studying electrical engineering in \
  the 1980s he discovered troff, TeX, and \
  digital type, and so had his latent interest \
  in typefaces revived, because now he could use \
  them himself. In 2005, while studying the \
  language Esperanto, he started adding accented \
  letters for that language to existing fonts, \
  for his own use; before long he was struggling \
  to make the unaccented letters too, in spite \
  of chronic hand pain and the need to use a \
  special input device.</p> \
  <p>He lives in Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA, \
  with his wife, their computers, their \
  bookshelves, and their numerous dust bunnies.</p>
