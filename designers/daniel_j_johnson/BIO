bio: <p>I've been doing web development since the mid-90's, but \
  I didn't get into typography until about 2008.  My interests \
  vary widely from orthography to history (my speciality is \
  mediaeval eastern Europe) to literature to vocal music, \
  both Western and Near Eastern.</p> \
  <p>I've designed close to a dozen fonts so far, mostly \
  released under Libre licenses.  I've also contributed a \
  number of Unicode ranges to the GNU FreeFont project.</p>
