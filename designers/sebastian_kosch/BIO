bio: <p>I was born near Cologne, shortly after Germany's unification, into a family that tried to make me literate at age three. A version of <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/snowcap/snow-cap/" title="Snow Cap &laquo; MyFonts">SnowCap</a> on my uncle's brick-sized laptop first sparked interest in digital type a few years later. I became an open source disciple about five years ago, and have since been wondering why usable free fonts are so rare.</p><p>In 2009, I moved to Toronto to study Engineering Science after finishing high school and a year of military service.</p>
