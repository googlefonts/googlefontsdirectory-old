bio: <p>Annie started noticing letterforms at age 14, and took \
  her first calligraphy class a few years later. Through \
  teaching and free-lance work she continued to learn about \
  the form and structure of Latin letters, and worked once \
  with Hebrew. Although part of SIL International since 1987, \
  it was not until 2003 that Annie discovered that her \
  calligraphic background could serve the world's non-dominant \
  language communities through type design and font development. \
  Trained by colleague Victor Gaultney, she has made \
  contributions to SIL fonts such as Gentium, Charis SIL, \
  and Tai Heritage; she is currently team lead for the \
  Andika project.</p>
