bio: <p>I currently work for Google, working on fonts full-time.</p><p>I used to be \
  maintainer of Ghostscript, and have played a role in a number of other free software projects.\
  </p><p>I have a number of patents, all of which are available for licensing, and all of which \
  are subject to a patent grant for GPL-licensed software, including the Even Toned \
  Screening, an exceptionally high quality suite of halftoning algorithms for inkjet printers.</p>\
  <p>I'm the father of two amazing boys, Alan and Max.</p><p>I'm a member of the Berkeley Monthly \
  Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers).</p><p>I have completed a \
  <a href="http://levien.com/phd/phd.html">Ph.D.</a> on \
  techniques for interactive curve design. Spiro is a free software library containing these \
  techniques, and I also used those techniques to design a number of fonts, including \
  Inconsolata.</p><p>I previously did earlier attempt at a Ph.D., on Attack-Resistant \
  Trust Metrics. The best source for that work is the chapter in \
  <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/hci/book/978-1-84800-355-2">Computing with Social \
  Trust.</a></p>\
  <p>I have a Wikipedia <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raph_Levien'>entry</a>.\
  </p><p>I live in Berkeley, California with my boyfriend Seth.</p>
