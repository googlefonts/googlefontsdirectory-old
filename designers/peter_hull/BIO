bio: <p>I've been a typography fan since I \
  don't know when, but I've finally made \
  some typefaces myself and foisted them \
  upon an unsuspecting public. \
  Hopefully more will follow in due \
  course, in between hacking on Python, \
  Django, and various culinary exploits. \
  Until then, enjoy.  And remember, \
  friends don't let friends use \
  Comic Sans.</p>
