bio: <p>Jasper de Waard, born in 1996, first \
  came in contact with the beauty of type \
  design when he was 10, and developed his \
  skills as a type and graphic designer \
  ever since. He was born and raised in \
  Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and went \
  to a bilingual high school there, \
  training him to read and write English \
  fluently and have a more international \
  focus. He is currently in his third \
  year, three years before his exam. He \
  hopes to continue his practices in \
  the fields of type and graphic design \
  after he finishes school and release \
  many more typefaces in the future.</p> \
  <p>His love for the tiny details, \
  balance in proportions and urge for \
  perfection made him into what he is \
  today. However, the great support \
  and feedback from people on several \
  forums can't be denied as a great \
  source of inspiration and evaluation \
  material, giving him a greater \
  understanding of the method behind \
  type design. He is also available \
  for custom type work and identity \
  design.</p>
