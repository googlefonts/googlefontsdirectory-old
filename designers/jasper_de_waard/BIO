bio: <p>As you may already know, I'm Jasper. \
  Born in Rotterdam, Netherlands, on the \
  fourteenth of January 1996. Yes, that&#8217;s \
  right, I'm a teenager.</p> \
  <p>But why would a young kid want to \
  design fonts?</p> \
  <p>Well, when I was seven I used to make \
  pictures in Photoshop with my dad. Slow but \
  steady I learned everything about Photoshop. \
  Around the age of ten my Dad gave me some \
  space on his website to play with making \
  my own. Soon I wanted more. Yet, I realized \
  that designing logos was no option, simply \
  because nobody wants to buy a logo made \
  by a twelve year old kid. If I would design \
  fonts, and try and sell them, \
  people could see one of my fonts and only \
  afterwards find out I'm so young. \
  If they like one of my fonts, they may \
  just ignore my age and buy it.</p> \
  <p>I hope most people judge my fonts \
  for themselves, disregarding my age.</p> \
  <p>And for everyone who does like my \
  fonts, maybe even appreciates them \
  enough to buy them: thank you very much!</p>
