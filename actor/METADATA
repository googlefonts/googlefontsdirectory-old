description: <p>A diploma thesis project from the Aachen \
  University of Applied Sciences at Karl-Friedrich (Kai) \
  Oetzbach. The font originated in a course in type design. \
  The idea was to learn through the creation of a typeface \
  about writing as an information carrier. It was created \
  entirely digitally, so the path to the current version \
  is very rocky and winding.</p> \
  <p>Actor has a strong x-height, which is why it always \
  requires a fairly high line spacing. The digits of Actor \
  are created as old style figures. The forms of 6 and 9 \
  are more dynamic and more tense than usual. The 8 has \
  significantly shifted interiors and the 7 is slightly \
  curved to the left.</p>
