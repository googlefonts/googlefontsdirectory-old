description: <p>Merriweather was designed to be \
  a text face that pleasant to read on screens.</p> \
  <p>Merriweather is an evolving and will be updated. \
  As of now there is one style: Regular. \
  However, Heavy, Bold, and Light versions of these \
  are coming soon. There will also be Italic in each \
  of these weights. And fairly soon after that there \
  will also be a sans serif version which mirrors the \
  weights and styles of the Serif design.</p> \
  <p>Designed by Eben Sorkin, Merriweather features a \
  very large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, \
  a mild diagonal stress, sturdy serifs and open \
  forms.</p> \
  <p>Because Merriweather is a work in progress and \
  will will be \
  improved regularly. This means you can request \
  improvements and even fund specific features if \
  if they are outside of the current scope of work. \
