description: <p>Merriweather was designed to be \
  pleasant to read on screens.</p> \
  <p>Merriweather is an evolving text face \
  being made and updated for Google Fonts. As of now \
  there is one style: Regular. However, Bold, Italic, \
  and Bold Italic are coming soon. In addition to the \
  Latin script now partially covered, Merriweather will \
  also come in Cyrillic Greek and Arabic.</p> \
  <p>Designed by Eben Sorkin, Merriweather features a \
  very large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, \
  a mild diagonal stress, sturdy serifs and open forms. \
  Merriweather is a work in progress and will will be \
  improved regularly. This means you can request \
  improvements and even fund specific features if \
  they are not already funded. For more information \
  and to stay updated see \
