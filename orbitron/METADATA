description: <p>Orbitron is a geometric \
  sans-serif typeface intended for display \
  purposes. It features four weights (light, \
  medium, bold, and black), a stylistic \
  alternative, small caps, and a ton of \
  alternate glyphs. Orbitron was designed \
  so that graphic designers in the future \
  will have some alternative to typefaces \
  like Eurostile or Bank Gothic. If you’ve \
   ever seen a futuristic sci-fi movie, \
  you have may noticed that all other fonts \
  have been lost or destroyed in the \
  apocalypse that led humans to flee earth. \
  Only those very few geometric typefaces \
  have survived to be used on spaceship \
  exteriors, spacestation signage, \
  monopolistic corporate branding, \
  uniforms featuring aerodynamic \
  shoulder pads, etc. Of course Orbitron \
  could also be used on the posters for \
  the movies portraying this inevitable \
  future. It was initially published on the \
  <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com">League \
  of Movable Type</a>.</p>
