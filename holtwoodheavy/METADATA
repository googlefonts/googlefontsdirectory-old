description: <p>Holtwood is a bold display font \
  developed for use with modern web browsers. It has \
  a lot of the look of some traditional woodblock \
  poster typefaces of the Nineteenth Century but \
  updated for the Twenty First. Holtwood was \
  envisioned to be used in big and bold text \
  sizes, but it still works well when running \
  as smaller headlines too.</p>
