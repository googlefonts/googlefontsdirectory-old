description: <p>Vibur is a font based on handwriting. \
  Author of the typeface Johan Kallas set out to \
  create a display font from his own handwriting \
  by making it more pronounced and re-modelling \
  the strokes - making it nicer than his actual \
  handwriting is - that can be used for various \
  typesetting contexts. It comes with numerous \
  ligatures that can be activated with OpenType \
  features. The curvy style is best combined with \
  playful and bright designs.</p>
