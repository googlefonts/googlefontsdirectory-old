description: <p>Wallpoet is inspired by the often political, \
  short, sometimes provocative, sometimes funny or both, \
  messages found on city walls, sprayed by some anonymous \
  agent. Words, images or both!</p> \
  <p>The idea behind the font is making a font with a bit \
  of punch, but still easy to use for template graffiti. \
  Print, cut & spray - being the key concept. That's why \
  it has no curves and off course is a stencil font.</p> \
  <p>With the font, Lars wants to pay respect to the \
  urban guerilla scene, which has inspired him so often \
  with its total disrespect for the traditional and \
  ingenious ability to break out of the traditional box.</p>
