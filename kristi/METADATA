  inspired by old chancery typefaces and it \
  is made with a basic felt-pen by using bold \
  and quick moves while writing.</p> \
  <p>The most distinctive characteristics of \
  this type are tall ascenders and descenders, \
  slim vertical lines and little twists like \
  the letter "g" in the text. It is advised \
  to use Kristi for a title or text at quite \
  large sizefor example as a logotype or \
  heading.</p> \
  <p>Kristi is designed by Birgit Pulk, a \
  graphic designer from Estonia. The name of \
