description: <p>Calligraffitti by Open Window owes \
  its credit to mom and all her years of Calligraphic \
  experience. This impromptu rendering of her \
  calligraphic alphabet captures her years or \
  formal practice blended with a rare encounter \
  with the mood altering music of Santana.</p>
