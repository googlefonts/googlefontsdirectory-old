description: <p>Contrary to popular lore, Walter \
  Turncoat was NOT a traitor executed during the \
  Revolutionary War. Actually, Walter spent his \
  days carefully executing new typefaces doing \
  his part to help establish a free press! Ever \
  the patriot, Squid honors old Walter with this \
  spiffy font sure to bring out the Yankee Doodle \
  in you.</p> \
  <p>* All characters described above are \
  fictitious with the possible exception of \
  Squid, whose existence remains an ongoing \
  debate. Nevertheless you should check out \
  his other fonts.</p>
