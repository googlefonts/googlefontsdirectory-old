description: <p>With their elegant style Didones are \
  often used in the context of fashion \
  related design, such as the logo type of the magazine  \
  Vogue, and therefore fill in a rather big and popular  \
  niche of design purposes.</p> \
  <p>Bigshot One is a modern Didone for headlines  \
  and display. The squarish counters give the design a  \
  contemporary look while its rounded and angled  \
  details in the thin strokes catch the interest  \
  of the viewer.</p>
