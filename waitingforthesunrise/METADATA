description: <p>Waiting for the Sunrise is based on \
  the handwriting of a high school student. \
  The title comes from the song \
  <a href="http://theafters.com/music/">Lift \Me Up by The Afters</a>. \
  Although this font was created during a time of \
  darkness in my life, it is a cheery, perky font. \
  It is a reminder to me of the joy that comes \
  after mourning.</p>
