description: <p>Waiting for the Sunrise is based on the handwriting of a high school student.  The title comes from the song <a href="http://theafters.com/music/">Lift Me Up by The Afters</a>.   Although this font was created during a time of darkness in my life, it is a cheery, perky font.  It is a reminder to me of the joy that comes after mourning.</p>


profile: <p>I enjoy creative arts of every kind including theater, photography, and graphic design.  After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in Liberal Studies, I became a stay-at-home mom.   Creating fonts allowed me to use my love of art in a new way while I was at home with my daughters.</p><p>I am passionate about God, orphan care, and sustainable development.  I enjoy studying languages in my spare time.  I live in Tianjin, China with my husband and 2 daughters.</p>
