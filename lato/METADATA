description: <p>Lato is a sanserif typeface family \
  designed in the Summer 2010 by Warsaw-based \
  designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” \
  in Polish). In December 2010 the Lato family \
  was published under the open-source Open Font \
  License by his foundry tyPoland, with support \
  from Google.</p> \
  <p>In the last ten or so years, during which \
  Łukasz has been designing type, most of his \
  projects were rooted in a particular design \
  task that he needed to solve. With Lato, it \
  was no different. Originally, the family was \
  conceived as a set of corporate fonts for a \
  large client — who in the end decided to go \
  in different stylistic direction, so the \
  family became available for a public \
  release.</p> \
  <p>When working on Lato, Łukasz tried to \
  carefully balance some potentially \
  conflicting priorities. He wanted to create \
  a typeface that would seem quite “transparent” \
  when used in body text but would display some \
  original traits when used in larger sizes. He \
  used classical proportions (particularly visible \
  in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar \
  harmony and elegance. At the same time, he created \
  a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the \
  fact that Lato was designed in 2010 — even though \
  it does not follow any current trend.</p> \
  <p>The semi-rounded details of the letters give \
  Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong \
  structure provides stability and seriousness. \
  “Male and female, serious but friendly. With \
  the feeling of the Summer,” says Łukasz.</p> \
  <p>Lato consists of five weights (plus corresponding \
  italics), including a beautiful hairline style.</p> \
