SOURCES
Gentium Plus v1.504
========================


This file describes the source files included with the Gentium Plus font family. This information should be distributed along with the Gentium Plus fonts and any derivative works.

As a reminder: these source files are Copyright (c) 2003-2010 SIL International
(http://www.sil.org/), with Reserved Font Names "Gentium" and "SIL".
This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.


Note that the primary source files for the fonts are the fonts themselves. They contain all the important data in the fonts and can be studied and modified using open font tools such as FontForge and TTX (which can both export to text-based formats). To make further development easier we provide some additional files:

FontLab "*-designsource.vfb" files: These .vfb files are FontLab source files (one for each font weight) and contain all the glyph outline data for the Gentium Plus fonts. Please note that it is not possible to generate fonts from these files that are identical to the final versions, as some postprocessing is done on the fonts after generation from FontLab. They are provided solely as a source for PostScript-style bézier outlines.

OpenType "*-designsource.otf" files: These are CFF-flavored OpenType fonts containing PostScript-style outlines. These are not intended as installable fonts, and we do not support that use. They are provided as a non-proprietary source of PostScript-style bézier outlines and can be opened by many font design programs, including FontForge.

Anchor "*-anchors.xml" files: These are XML files containing data on anchors (attachment points) used in creating composite glyphs and OpenType/Graphite code. This anchor data is present in the .vfb files, but this is a separate, non-proprietary, text-based source for that information.

Graphite code: See the README.txt file in the graphite folder for details.

The code used to insert OpenType tables into the font is not currently included as it relies upon a complex collection of Perl libraries, but we are looking into providing it in the future.
