# 2011-02-03 TODO originaldesigner: Who made the VT323 font?

approved: true
description: <p>This font was created from the \
  glyphs of the DEC VT320 text terminal, which I \
  used in college, and for which I have retained \
  an unaccountable nostalgia.</p> \
  <p>I used a variety of tools, including Gimp, \
  Python/PIL, and of course, FontForge.  The \
  VT320 glyphs were designed with a nonrectangular \
  pixel aspect ratio to fit the way the terminal \
  scanned the CRT, so for this VT323 variation \
  I had Python munge the locations and attempt \
  to emulate the way the electron beam actually \
  illuminated the phosphor and smeared the \
  pixels horizontally on the terminal's CRT, \
  so it looks more like what the actual glyph \
  looked like on the screen. Python then drew \
  the proper pixels into a 1:1 pixel grid as \
  a monochrome PNG, which FontForge autoscanned \
  into outlines.  I have attempted to support \
  most of the glyphs available on the VT320, \
  but that is a limited set to begin with, \
  so please don't be disappointed that I \
  haven't supported Esperanto or Riograndenser \
  Hunsr√ºckisch or whatever.</p> \
  <p>There is another earlier variation \
  called "VT321" that uses a more standard \
  1:1 pixel drawing technique, if you want \
  to grab that as well.  I personally like \
  VT323 better, and actually use it as my \
  terminal font when cruising on the \
  command line.</p>
