description: <p>Raleway is an elegant \
  sans-serif typeface, designed in a \
  single thin weight. It is a display \
  face that features both old style \
  and lining numerals, standard and \
  discretionary ligatures, a pretty \
  complete set of diacritics, as well \
  as a stylistic alternate inspired \
  by more geometric sans-serif typefaces \
  than it’s neo-grotesque inspired \
  default character set.</p> \
