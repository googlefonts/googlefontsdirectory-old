description: <p>News Cycle is a realist, sans-serif typeface \
  based primarily on a revival of the 1908-era News Gothic, \
  the stalwart newspaper face from American Type Founders \
  (ATF).  Like News Gothic, it is designed for clarity and \
  readability in large blocks of copy, but to still look \
  good in headline-sizes at the top of the page.  It also \
  extends News Gothic to better cover more of the world's \
  orthographies, starting with Eastern European and African \
  languages, and soon Greek and Cyrillic alphabets \
  as well.</p>
