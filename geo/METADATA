description: <p>I was shown squared-off lettering on a record label and \
   asked to draw something similar. Geo, the result, was \
  substantially completed within four hours in July 1999. \
  Itâ€™s a simple geometric typeface in the mould of some of \
  the experimental faces designed during the 1920s by well-known \
  modernist designers such as Theo van Doesberg and Herbert Bayer.</p> \
  <p>This style found a strong echo in designs of Neville Brody \
  in the 1980s, which are now identified as an expression of the \
  consumer culture of that decade. During the 1990s the magazine \
  and font catalogue Emigre was at the public front of typeface \
  design, and was a place where computer fonts with this same \
  look appeared.</p> \
  <p>I think Geo expresses both the directness of some of the \
  1920s faces and the rather disingenuous consumerist thrust of \
  the 1980s and 1990s descendants of theirs.</p>
