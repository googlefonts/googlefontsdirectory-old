description: <p>Nothing You Could Do is based on the \
  handwriting of a photographer friend. I chose the \
  name because it echoes my love for my husband and \
  children and how my love for them is unconditional \
  and not based on anything they could do or say. I \
  love this handwriting because it is human, it is \
  imperfect, and it is natural.  Real humans don’t \
  write perfectly neatly, and this font creates \
  that feeling of authenticity.</p>
