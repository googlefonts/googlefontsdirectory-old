description: <p>Nothing You Could Do is based on the handwriting of a photographer friend.   The name is taken from the lyrics of Avril Lavigne’s Keep Holding On (lyrics by Avril Lavigne and Lukasz Gottwald).  I chose the name because it echoes my love for my husband and children and how my love for them is unconditional and not based on anything they could do or say. I love this handwriting because it is human, it is imperfect, and it is natural.  Real humans don’t write perfectly neatly, and this font creates that feeling of authenticity.</p>

profile: <p>I enjoy creative arts of every kind including theater, photography, and graphic design.  After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in Liberal Studies, I became a stay-at-home mom.   Creating fonts allowed me to use my love of art in a new way while I was at home with my daughters.</p><p>I am passionate about God, orphan care, and sustainable development.  I enjoy studying languages in my spare time.  I live in Tianjin, China with my husband and 2 daughters.</p>
