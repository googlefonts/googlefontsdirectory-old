description: <p>Inspired by the writing of \
  the daughter of an architect (surprise, surprise!), \
  this font incorporates the graphic, squared look of \
  architectural writing, combined with the natural \
  feel of daily handwriting.</p>

profile: <p>I enjoy creative arts of every kind including theater, photography, and graphic design.  After graduating with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Liberal Studies, I became a stay-at-home mom.   Creating fonts allowed me to use my love of art in a new way while I was at home with my daughters.</p><p>I am passionate about God, orphan care, and sustainable development.  I enjoy studying languages in my spare time.  I live in Tianjin, China with my husband and 2 daughters.</p>
