description: <p>Noticia Text is a \
  contemporary humanist slab serif typeface \
  designed to be used for running text on digital newspapers \
  (both on websites and mobile apps). It has a large x-height, \
  ample proportions, big serifs and large apertures that allow \
  the letters to be clear, even at small sizes on low \
  resolution screens. The capitals are unusually small, \
  allowing them to be used as substitutes for small caps. \
  (Its recommended to add some tracking if used in \
  this way.)</p> \
  <p>One major feature is the break in the internal curves of \
  round characters. While this break makes some interesting \
  forms at large sizes, their true purpose is to help \
  make the counterforms more open at small sizes by allowing \
  straighter stems. This reasoning is famously known as \
  W.A. Dwiggins' “M-formula.”</p> \
  <p>The italics were designed to contrast with the roman \
  styles while maintaining good legibility. The true italic \
  forms also have big counterforms and simple curves.</p> \
  <p>The fonts have been manually hinted to get the best \
  possible rasterization in Windows.</p> \
  <p>The Noticia font family project is envisioned as 18 \
  different fonts styles, with text, condensed, display \
  and sans variants, different weights and including \
  italic versions, all designed and hinted to work well \
  on computer and mobile devices screens.</p>
