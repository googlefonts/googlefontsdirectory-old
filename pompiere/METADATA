description: <p>Pompiere is a low contrast condensed \
  sans serif font. However unlike most sans it has very \
  tall ascenders and and very small x height. Pompiere \
  is playful and even a little sweet. This font was \
  inspired by a handmade sign seen outside of NYC \
  firefighters Squad Co. 18 in the West Village of \
  Manhattan. Because of its small x height and modest \
  weight it will work best at medium to large sizes.</p>
