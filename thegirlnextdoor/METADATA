description: <p>'the girl next door' is \
  based on the handwriting of a middle \
  school geography teacher.</p> \
  <p>From her personality to her \
  handwriting, she is the typical \
  girl next door - she puts you at \
  ease in every situation and is \
  perfectly comfortable and confident \
  in who she is.  Her handwriting \
  reflects that and is readable, \
  neat, and yet comfortable and \
  welcoming.</p>
