description: <p>The Girl Next Door is \
  based on the handwriting of a middle \
  school geography teacher.</p> \
  <p>From her personality to her \
  handwriting, she is the typical \
  girl next door- she puts you at \
  ease in every situation and is \
  perfectly comfortable and confident \
  in who she is.  Her handwriting \
  reflects that and is readable, \
  neat, and yet comfortable and \
  welcoming.</p>

profile: <p>I enjoy creative arts of every kind including theater, photography, and graphic design.  After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in Liberal Studies, I became a stay-at-home mom.   Creating fonts allowed me to use my love of art in a new way while I was at home with my daughters.</p><p>I am passionate about God, orphan care, and sustainable development.  I enjoy studying languages in my spare time.  I live in Tianjin, China with my husband and 2 daughters.</p>
