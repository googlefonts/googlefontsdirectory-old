description: <p>The Cabin Font is a humanist sans \
  inspired by Edward Johnston’s and Eric \
  Gill’s typefaces, with a touch of modernism. \
  Cabin incorporates modern proportions, \
  optical adjustments, and some elements \
  of the geometric sans.</p>

It remains true to its roots, but has its own personality.
