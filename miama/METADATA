description: <p><em>Miama</em> is based on the many handwritten \
  letters of my girlfriend. Among them are \
  also some ligatures and ornamental glyphs.</p> \
  <p>Every single glyph has been drawn by myself \
  using the free font editor FontForge.</p> \
  <p>Do not use any condensed nor extended spacing! \
  <em>Miama</em> lives from connected \
  strokes, which are killed as soon as you change spacing.</p> \
  <p>Use <em>Miama</em> for main titles, short poems, greeting cards, wedding \
  stuff et cetera. But please do not consider using it for longer texts, \
  especially not for scientific texts.</p> \
  <p><em>Miama</em> is a very small typeface compared to other fonts. \
  This is due to the very large \
  ascenders and descenders. So if you want to look <em>Miama</em> as a \
  font of 10pt, choose 15-20pt. Also keep in mind, that <em>Miama</em> \
  then still looks quite light, so you want probably resize it even more \
  for titles.</p>
