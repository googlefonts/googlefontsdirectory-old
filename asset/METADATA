description: <p><strong>Designer: Riccardo De Franceschi</strong></p> \
  Asset was inspired by the engraved letters found on \
  United States dollar bills. Asset belongs to the "fat \
  face" category because it is so bold or heavy. It is \
  also a high contrast design and very extended or wide. \
  Although it is legible at medium sizes it will shine \
  most when used large where both its restraint and \
  passion can be seen. This font was made specifically \
  to be web type, however it will work well in print \
  as well.
