description: <p>Atomic Age science meets ultra cool \
  with this swingin' retro latin sharp serif font we \
  call Fontdiner Swanky! Like the older much hipper \
  brother of it's Loungy counterpart, Swanky brings \
  his bolder style and charming good looks when it's \
  time to really let the neighbors know you mean \
  business!</p>
