description: <p>Hammersmith is a very low contrast typeface \
  inspired by the Johnston UK lettering tradition. Hammersmith \
  shows the quirks of a somewhat naive, handmade, brush \
  written letters including a wider than normal "e" and "s" \
  as well as dark joins between stroke which are normally \
  compensated for in type. The sources for this design have \
  been adapted not just for type but specifically for use \
  as a web type. This font works well to even smaller sizes \
  than was originally expected.</p>
