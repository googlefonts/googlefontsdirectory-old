# Dual licensing fonts within a Unicode range is not a best practise and very likely to introduce confusion and problems.

description: <p>Jura is a family of sans-serif fonts in \
  the Eurostile vein. It was originally inspired by some \
  work I was doing for the \
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/">FreeFont</a> \
  project in designing a Kayah Li range for FreeMono. \
  I wanted to create a Roman alphabet using the same kinds \
  of strokes and curves as the Kayah Li glyphs, and thus \
  Jura was born.  It has been expanded to include \
  glyphs for the Cyrillic and Greek alphabets as well.</p> \
  <p>The original Kayah Li glyphs have been included in this \
  font. (Note that glyphs for writing mainstream Burmese are \
  not and never have been a part of this font.)</p> \
  <p>Jura is available in four weights: Light, Book, \
  Medium, and DemiBold. A new version is in the works, \
  which will add OpenType diacritic placement and a few \
  glyph improvements.</p> \
  <p>The Jura family has an unfortunate name clash with \
  Ed Merritt&rsquo;s \
  <a href="http://www.tenbytwenty.com/products/typefaces/jura">Jura \
  serif font</a>.</p>
