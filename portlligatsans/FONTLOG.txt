FONTLOG for the Port Lligat fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Port Lligat Sans
Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Port Lligat Sans fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Port Lligat Sans is a display typeface. It has a soft variation 
on strokes, vertical stress, and a well balance groovy rhythm. 
It is particularly useful for both short text and headlines, 
but it is also comfortable for reading on screen. It is designed 
to become a super family with styles in many different 
typographical categories. The first releases, the regular Roman 
styles of the Sans and Slab families, have the same visual 
weight and width. The space is visually balanced for each 
style. As a result they can be used together in many 
different ways.
