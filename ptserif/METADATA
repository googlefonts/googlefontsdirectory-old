description: <p>PT Serif™ is the second pan-Cyrillic font family \
  developed for the project “Public Types of Russian Federation”. \
  The first family of the project PT Sans was released in 2009.</p> \
  <p>PT Serif and PT Sans were released with \
  open user license and can be freely distributed. The main aim \
  of the project is to give possibility to the peoples of Russia \
  to read and write on their native languages.</p> \
  <p>The project is dedicated to 300-year \
  anniversary of the civil type invented by Peter the Great \
  in 1708–1710 years and was realized with financial support \
  from Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.</p> \
  <p>The fonts beside standard Western, Central European and \
  Cyrillic code pages contain characters of all title languages \
  of Russian Federation that make them unique and very important \
  tool of the modern digital communications.</p> \
  <p>PT Serif is a transitional serif face with humanistic \
  terminals designed for use together with PT Sans and \
  harmonized with PT Sans on metrics, proportions, weights \
  and design.</p> \
  <p>PT Serif consists of six styles: regular and bold \
  weights with corresponding italics form a standard \
  computer font family for basic text setting; two caption \
  styles (regular and italic) are for texts of small point \
  sizes.</p> \
  <p>Designed by Alexandra Korolkova, Olga Umpeleva and \
  Vladimir Yefimov. Released by \
  <a href=http://www.paratype.com/public/>ParaType</a> in \
  2010.</p>
