description: <p>Garamont’s fonts have set a \
  milestone, on which font designers have been \
  recurring ever since. EB Garamond is an open \
  source project to create a revival of Claude \
  Garamont’s famous humanist typeface from the \
  mid-16th century. Its design reproduces the \
  original design by Claude Garamont: The source \
  for the letterforms is a scan of a specimen \
  known as the “Berner specimen”, which, \
  composed in 1592 by Conrad Berner, son-in-law \
  of Christian Egenolff and his successor at \
  the Egenolff print office, shows Garamont’s \
  roman and Granjon’s italic fonts at \
  different sizes. Hence the name of this \
  project: Egenolff-Berner Garamond.</p> \
  <p>Why another Garamond? The Garamonds are \
  probably the most copied typefaces in \
  the world. There are indeed lots of \
  excellent Garamond fonts, also such that \
  try to approach the original in the same \
  way as EB Garamond does. In the world of \
  free software, however, only few \
  Garamond-inspired fonts exist, and as far \
  as I know, none with the scope of EB \
  Garamond. I know that competition is hard \
  in this field, and these fonts won’t be \
  able to stand up to their commercial \
  counterparts for quite some time. \
  Nevertheless, it's time for the \
  open source community to have a classical \
  Garamond and I promise, I’ll try hard \
  to learn and give my best.</p>
