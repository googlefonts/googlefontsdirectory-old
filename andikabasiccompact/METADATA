font.AndikaBasicCompact-Regular.ttf.description: <p>Andika Basic Regular is \
  released as the foundation for the Andika font family and italic, bold, \
  and bold italic are yet to come.</p><p>SIL's "Basic" Roman fonts -- Andika \
  Basic, Gentium Basic, and Gentium Book Basic -- have a limited character \
  set, supporting only the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement Unicode \
  ranges, plus a selection of the more commonly used extended Latin \
  characters, with miscellaneous diacritical marks, symbols and \
  punctuation.</p><p>A much more complete character set, comparable to \
  Charis SIL and Doulos SIL, will be supported in a future version of \
  Andika. This "Basic" font is intended to provide an Andika with stable \
  letterforms for both default and alternate glyphs. No need to request \
  additional glyphs or characters to be supported in the Basic fonts - \
  such support will become available in the full font in the future.</p>
