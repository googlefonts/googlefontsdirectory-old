description: <p>Ksenia Erulevich, designer of the Alice \
  typeface, was inspired by Lewis Carrol's novel and \
  decided to make a typeface that will be suitable for \
  typesetting that book.</p> \
  <p>It came out eclectic and quaint, old-fashioned, \
  having widened proportions, open aperture, and soft \
  rounded features; perfect for long meditative \
  text-setting and headlines.</p> \
  <p>This is in fact Ksenia's first typeface, as part of \
  her diploma project in a Type and Typography course \
  in Moscow, Russia.</p> \
  <p>Released by Cyreal with help from Gayaneh \
  Bagdasaryan and Alexei Vanyashin.</p>
