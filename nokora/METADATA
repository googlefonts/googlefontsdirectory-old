description: <p>This font was designed especially for the \
  user interfaces of mobile platforms. The metrics are \
  compatible with the Latin glyphs of Droid Sans and \
  the number of glyphs is less than in other Khmer \
  fonts, so the file size of font is smaller and loads \
  faster on the web. The font has been prepared specially \
  for use on the web.</p> \
  <p>This version of Nokora has the OpenType tables \
  required for Khmer rendering with the Harfbuzz \
  found in Android 3.1+ and Android 4.0. \
  The OpenType tables in this font also work with \
  Uniscribe system in Microsoft Windows \
  the CoreText system found in Apple Mac OS X Lion.</p>
