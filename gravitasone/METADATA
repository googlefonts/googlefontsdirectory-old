description: <p>Gravitas One is modeled on the "UK fat face" \
  which is a kind of very heavy advertising type created during \
  the industrial revolution in England. The letter forms are \
  characterized by an attention getting and strong contrast \
  between the very heavy vertical shapes and the thin \
  horizontal ones. The contrast of the design means that \
  it will be most useful when set from medium to large sizes.</p>
