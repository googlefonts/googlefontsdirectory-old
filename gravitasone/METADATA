description: <p><strong>Designer: Riccardo De Franceschi</strong></p> \
  <p>Gravitas One is modeled on the "UK fat face" which is a kind \
  of very heavy advertising type created during the industrial \
  revolution in England. The letter forms are characterized by \
  an attention getting and strong contrast between the very \
  heavy vertical shapes and the thin horizontal ones. The \
  contrast of the design means that it will be most useful \
  when set from medium to large sizes.</p>
