description: <p>Just Me Again Down Here \
  was created a few weeks after my family \
  and I moved to China, using a Wacom \
  Tablet and Adobe Illustrator.</p> \
  <p>This is my “messy” handwriting with \
  mixed capitals and irregularities.   \
  After moving to China and finding myself \
  without the ability to communicate in my \
  new home country’s language, creating \
  a font was something that reminded me \
  that I did know how to do <em>something</em> \
  and I would survive those first confusing \
  weeks abroad.</p>
