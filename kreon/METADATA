description: <p>Kreon targets text typesetting for magazines \
  and news sites. With a slight slab-serif look and the low \
  contrast design, it is a sturdy typeface for your website, \
  blog or online magazine. Its friendly feel will soon be \
  accompanied by a sans serif as well as italics. Enjoy.</p>
