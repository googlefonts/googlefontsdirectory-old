description: <p>I always been attracted to condensed \
  typefaces, and one of the first I came across \
  was Empire, designed by Morris Benton Fuller \
  for ATF in 1937. I first spotted it in an architecture \
  book at my college's library while doing homework.</p> \
  <p>Dorsa is a modern interpretation of Empire with \
  some personal details. When I start sketching I knew \
  it would be a little less condensed than the original \
  Empire because I wanted it to be used for use in titles, \
  and combined with positive letter spacing it gives \
  an elegant look to text. Although the original hasn't \
  got a lowercase, I studied a lot of skyline typefaces \
  and drew a fully original lowercase.</p> \
  <p>I started with lowercase “o”, which isn't \
  completely geometric, it is expanded to the \
  outside, keeping the same whitespace through \
  all weights. And this repeats all over the \
  typeface, because the construction of all \
  the characters was modular, based on that “o”; \
  the “f” is designed to not meet any of the diacritics; \
  and uppercase “A” has a traditional form, because \
  I think this is more legible.</p>
