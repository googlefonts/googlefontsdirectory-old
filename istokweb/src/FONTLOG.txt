Istok 0.4.2-web is a sans serif typeface with web specific 
vertical metrics. At present it has four fonts with
support for Latin and Cyrillic. Most glyphs are manually 
instructed using xgridfit, while others are autoinstructed 
by FontForge.

The fonts are distributed under the terms of Open Font License 
version 1.1.

The non-web sources and truetype fonts are available at

The history of the font
=======================

The modified version of CM Bright font was used for design of several
letters as raw material, other charaters are designed from scratch.

These fonts started with the original OFL licensed TTFs at
version 0.4.2 and I changed the vertical metrics to follow the
Google Web Fonts guidelines and the font name to 'Istok Web' 
My intention is for these font versions to be integrated 
into the upstream distribution by Andrey. (2011-07-08)
