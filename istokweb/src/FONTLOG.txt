Istok is new sans serif typeface. At present it has four fonts with
support for Latin and Cyrillic. Most glyphs are manually instructed
using xgridfit, but another ones are autoinstructed in fontforge.

The fonts are distributed by the original developer 
under the terms of Open Font License version 1.1 or 
GNU General Public License Version 3 with the following exception:

As a special exception, if you create a document which uses this font,
and embed this font or unaltered portions of this font into the
document, this font does not by itself cause the resulting document to
be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
however invalidate any other reasons why the document might be covered
by the GNU General Public License. If you modify this font, you may
extend this exception to your version of the font, but you are not
obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
statement from your version.

The font sources have only GNU General Public License Version 3.

The history of the font
=======================

The modified version of CM Bright font was used for design of several
letters as raw material, other charaters are designed from scratch.

The TTF files available under the SIL Open Font License v1.1 
were modified, changing their vertical metrics to follow the
Google Web Fonts guidelines and the font name to 'Istok Web' 
by Dave Crossland. Dave's intention is for these font versions 
to be integrated into the upstream distribution. (2011-07-08)
