description: <p>Vollkorn is my first serious font. I wanted to create a restrained, \
  well-functioning font for reading &mdash; with the resulting high demands on word image, \
  line binding and readability. For this I have defined a large x-height that is almost \
  to the upper length ratio of 2:3.</p>
  <p>Vollkorn will work as written mainly in consultation and read size. Therefore, \
  it is designed as a whole and in detail relatively robust, strong, healthy and dark. \
  In support for the eyes the serifs on the center line level are increasingly easy and 
  unobtrusive.</p>
