description: <p>Poly is a medium contrast \
  serif font. With short ascenders \
  and a very high x-height, Poly is efficient \
  in small sizes. Thanks to its careful balance \
  between the x-height and glyph widths, it \
  allows more economy and legibility than \
  standard web serifs, even in small sizes. \
  This font was originally designed to compose \
  texts in agglutinative languages; these \
  contain very long words. The goal was to \
  develop a typeface that would tolerate \
  cramped tracking and that would increase \
  the number of letters on a single line.</p> \
  <p>Poly is a Unicode typeface family \
  that supports Open Type features and \
  languages that use the Latin script \
  and its variants, especially Native \
  South American language families.</p>
