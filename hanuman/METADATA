  <p>The Hanuman fonts are designed for readable and beautiful \
  rendering of text in the Khmer script, the national language \
  of Cambodia. The designer, \
  <a href="http://khmertype.blogspot.com/">Danh Hong</a>, has \
  many years of experience creating fonts for Khmer and other \
  Southeast Asian languages, and is actively involved in the \
  <a href="http://www.khmeros.info/">KhmerOS</a> project, \
  dedicated to a vision where Cambodians can learn and use \
  computers in their own language.</p>
