description: <p>Abril Fatface is part of a bigger type \
  family system, with 18 Display and Text styles. \
  The titling weights, based on a contemporary revamp \
  of classic Didone styles, display both neutrality \
  and strong presence on the page, attracting the \
  reader's attention with meassured tension in its \
  curves, good color and high contrast.</p> \
  <p>The Fatface in particular is inspired by heavy \
  titling fonts used in advertising posters in the \
  19th century Britain and France. The thin serifs \
  and clean curves lend the typeface a refined touch \
  and give any headline an elegant appearance. The \
  character set that supports over 50 languages \
  including those from Central and Northern Europe.</p> \
  <p>Abril has been designed by TypeTogether, \
  Veronika Burian & Jos√© Scaglione. The additional \
  weights of Abril can be seen at \
