description: <p>The idea of geometric typefaces with a \
  look reminiscent of the machinery, technology, and \
  interior design of the 1950s originated in Eurostile \
  family by Aldo Novarese and Alessandro Butti (1952).</p> \
  <p>Iceland is a modular square-shaped webfont with \
  a cold brutal character designed with the intension \
  to perform well on screen starting from low \
  resolutions. For this purpose the strokes are \
  deliberately kept vertical and diagonal cuts have \
  a 45Â° angle, outlines are rounded.</p> \
  <p>Features like wide proportions and generous \
  x-height are introduced for better legibility. \
  Unconventional and simplified letterforms like \
  k, f, r aid readability at small sizes. While \
  at display sizes they add a crisp and sharp \
  impression.</p>
  <p>Uppercase letters are decently heavier \
  compared to lowercase as a tribute to the \
  old typographic tradition. This way uppercase \
  is easily distinguished from lowercase, and \
  allows scaling down to be used as Small Caps.</p> \
  <p>Because of its ascetic modular character \
  and squarish proportions Iceland webfont is \
  easily integrated in modular grids and \
  logotypes.</p> \
  <p>Iceland is designed by Viktor Kharyk in 2011.</p>
