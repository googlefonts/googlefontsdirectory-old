description: <p>The idea of geometric typefaces \
  with a look reminiscent of the machinery, \
  technology, and interior design of the 1950s \
  originated in Eurostile family by Aldo Novarese \
  and Alessandro Butti (1952).</p> \
  <p>Iceland is a modular square-shaped webfont by Victor \
  Kharyk with a cold brutal character designed with the \
  intention to perform well on screen starting from low \
  resolutions. For this purpose the strokes are \
  deliberatly kept vertical and diagonal cuts have a \
  45° angle, outlines are rounded.</p> \
  <p>Features like wide proportions and generous x-height \
  are introduced for better legibility. Unconventional \
  and simplified letterforms like k, f, r aid readability \
  at small sizes. While at display sizes they add a \
  crisp and sharp impression.</p> \
  <p>Uppercase letters are decently heavier compared to \
  lowercase as a tribute to the old typographic tradition. \
  This way uppercase is easily distinguished from \
  lowercase, and allows scaling down to be used \
  as Small Caps.</p> \
  <p>Because of its ascetic modular character and squarish \
  proportions Iceland webfont is easily integrated in \
  modular grids and logotypes.</p>
