description: <p>How many characteristics is it possible \
  to add to a font, without changing its text type genre? \
   Petrona is inspired by every home's cook, who \
  playfully maneuvers ingredients and decors with a \
  personal touch, without derailing from the original \
  recipe.</p> \
  <p>This font has been created like in the kitchen, \
  with sharp elements that forge its structure and \
  with gestural strokes for finishing features.</p> \
  <p>Isolated, its glyphs are just ingredients. \
  Caps with heavy asymmetric serifs, and arms of \
  inverted angles, offer a certain flavor. Lower \
  cases with great "x" height, pronounced ascenders \
  and soft curves of low contrast, offer a different \
  flavor.  When combined in a word, they reveal a \
  contemporary bite.  They get lost when mingled \
  in a paragraph, to integrate again into a new menu \
  which is proposed by the text.</p> \
  <p>Petronas' expression evokes a personal culinary \
  style; its numbers of uniform height include \
  fractions to describe ingredients.  This is why \
  connoisseurs recommend it for culinary texts.  \
  But taste and creativity are personal, for \
  which every one will apply it according to \
  their own preference.</p>
