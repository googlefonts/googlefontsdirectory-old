description: <p>Andika is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant \
  font designed especially for literacy use, taking into \
  account the needs of beginning readers. The focus is on \
  clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms that will not be \
  readily confused with one another.</p> \
  <p>Starting with an initial draft of a basic lowercase \
  Latin alphabet by Victor Gaultney, Annie Olsen refined \
  the design and added over 4,700 glyphs, including a \
  complete extended Cyrillic set.</p> \
  <p>A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy \
  personnel for teaching people to read. Its forms are \
  simpler and less cluttered than those of most serif fonts. \
  For years, literacy workers have had to make do with fonts \
  that were not really suitable for beginning readers and \
  writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to \
  tediously assemble letters from a variety of fonts in order \
  to get all of the characters they need for their particular \
  language project, resulting in confusing and unattractive \
  publications. Andika addresses those issues.</p> \
  <p>One font from this typeface family is included in this \
  release, Andika Regular. A future release will include \
  Italic, Bold and Bold-Italic.</p> \
