description: <p>Andika ("Write!" in Swahili) is a sans serif, \
  Unicode-compliant font designed especially for literacy use, taking into \
  account the needs of beginning readers. The focus is on clear, \
  easy-to-perceive letterforms that will not be easily confused with one \
  another.</p><p>A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel \
  for teaching people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than \
  some serif fonts can be. For years, literacy workers have had to make do \
  with fonts that were available but not really suitable for beginning \
  readers and writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to \
  tediously cobble together letters from a variety of fonts in order to get \
  the all of characters they need for their particular language project, \
  resulting in confusing and unattractive publications. Andika addresses \
  those issues.</p>
font.Andika-BasicRegular.ttf.description: <p>Andika Basic Regular is \
  released as the foundation for the Andika font family and italic, bold, \
  and bold italic are yet to come.</p><p>SIL's "Basic" Roman fonts -- Andika \
  Basic, Gentium Basic, and Gentium Book Basic -- have a limited character \
  set, supporting only the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement Unicode \
  ranges, plus a selection of the more commonly used extended Latin \
  characters, with miscellaneous diacritical marks, symbols and \
  punctuation.</p><p>A much more complete character set, comparable to \
  Charis SIL and Doulos SIL, will be supported in a future version of \
  Andika. This "Basic" font is intended to provide an Andika with stable \
  letterforms for both default and alternate glyphs. No need to request \
  additional glyphs or characters to be supported in the Basic fonts - \
  such support will become available in the full font in the future.</p>
