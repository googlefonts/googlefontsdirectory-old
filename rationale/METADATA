description: <p>Rationale One is a compact monoline \
  webfont designed to work well on screen from large \
  headlines to 12 pt body copy.</p> \
  <p>The concept was to create a modular-based font \
  with optical corrections guided by snap eye \
  judgements. Such irregularities add a warm \
  impression to the overall strict geometrical \
  logic.</p> \
  <p>The idea of subtle stroke cuts originated from \
  the letter n, and was selectively incorporated \
  throughout the characters. This feature becomes \
  visible from 36 pt and above. In body sizes \
  stroke cuts enrich the typographic color with \
  light nuances.</p> \
  <p>Designed by Alexei Vanyashin in cooperation \
  with Olexa Volochay and Vladimir Pavlikov.</p>
