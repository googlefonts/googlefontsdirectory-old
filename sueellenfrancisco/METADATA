description: Sue Ellen Francisco is a tall, skinny font based on my own handwriting.  It was created in Adobe Illustrator, using a Wacom tablet.   It is named after a nickname I used for a friend.   It is one of my earlier fonts and is imperfect, but I still enjoy the tall, slender lines.

profile: <p>I enjoy creative arts of every kind including theater, photography, and graphic design.  After graduating with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Liberal Studies, I became a stay-at-home mom.   Creating fonts allowed me to use my love of art in a new way while I was at home with my daughters.</p><p>I am passionate about God, orphan care, and sustainable development.  I enjoy studying languages in my spare time.  I live in Tianjin, China with my husband and 2 daughters.</p>
