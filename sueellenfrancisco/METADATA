description: <p>Sue Ellen Francisco is a tall, skinny \
  font based on my own handwriting.  It was created \
  in Adobe Illustrator, using a Wacom tablet. \
  It is named after a nickname I used for a friend. \
  It is one of my earlier fonts and is imperfect, \
  but I still enjoy the tall, slender lines.</p>
