description: <p>Ezra SIL is \
  fashioned after the square letter forms of the typography of the Biblia \
  Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS), a beautiful Old Testament volume familiar \
  to biblical Hebrew scholars. It contains the basic set of Unicode \
  characters needed for Biblical Hebrew texts following the typeface and \
  traditions of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia. You should expect to get \
  the same typographic features and diacritic placement as is found in the \
  printed Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia 1967/77, 1983.</p><p>Ezra SIL SR \
  is a more contemporary version, with standard-shaped marks as used in \
  normal copies of the Tanakh. So the SR variation is more suitable for \
  general usage.</p><p>Please do not request of SIL \
  changes to the font that are not found in the BHS. Anyone can make their \
  own modified version of Ezra SIL (using a different name), but SIL \
  International will continue to maintain and develop the canonical version \
  of the Ezra SIL fonts. For information on what you're allowed to change \
  or modify, consult the OFL and OFL-FAQ.</p><p>At this point SIL is not \
  actively soliciting contributions to the project. Although they remain \
  the package maintainer, they do not currently plan major upgrades, but \
  will gratefully accept bug reports.</p> \
  <p><a href="http://www.hancock.dircon.co.uk">Ralph Hancock</a> was born \
  in London in 1948 and still lives there. He has \
  been working on fonts, keyboards and screen displays for ancient Greek and \
  non-roman scripts since the early 1980s, the era of DOS and 8-pin dot \
  matrix printers.</p><p>Work with TrueType fonts began when Windows 3 \
  became obsolete, so that it was no longer possible to use the popular \
  classical Greek writing system WinGreek. With the programmer Neil \
  Beshoori he developed its Windows 95 successor, Son of WinGreek, and \
  for this program he designed the Greek Old Face font, and several \
  other Greek fonts using the same 8-bit character set.</p><p>With the \
  arrival of Unicode, he worked with the programmer Denis Li√©geois to \
  create Antioch, an add-on for Microsoft Word for writing classical \
  Greek and Biblical Hebrew. This uses his standard Unicode roman, Greek \
  and Hebrew font called Vusillus. He has also designed other fonts for \
  roman and Greek only, such as Mediolanum; and a Hebrew font for use \
  with the Fluent Languages program, which places vowel points by means \
  of the Mac AAT system.</p><p>Later versions of Antioch have allowed the \
  full use of Hebrew cantillation marks as well as vowel points, so \
  that even the ultra-complex <em>Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</em> \
  text of the Old Testament can be rendered correctly in every detail. \
  For this purpose he developed the first full OpenType instruction set \
  for placing cantillation marks on Hebrew letters, including the multiple \
  marks demanded by the BHS. The first font of this type was Ezra SIL, \
  made specifically for the BHS; there is also a version for use with \
  other, more normal versions of the text, called Ezra SIL SR. The \
  Vusillus font issued with Antioch has the same OpenType system as \
  Ezra SIL SR for its Hebrew letters.</p><p>After Ralph began the \
  development of the OpenType layout features in Ezra SIL, John Hudson \
  borrowed the OpenType parts from him and adapted them to his own font, \
  <a href="http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_SBLHebrew.aspx"> \
  SBL Hebrew</a>. They then passed back and forth improvements and \
  suggestions as they worked on their separate projects, so that it was \
  no longer possible to say whose data was whose. Shared copyright and \
  MIT licensing was the best way to formalise this relationship and \
  enable to kinds of use of the layout intelligence that they wanted to \
  see, i.e. free use by anyone for any purpose without restriction.</p>
