description: <p>Ezra SIL is \
  fashioned after the square letter forms of the typography of the Biblia \
  Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS), a beautiful Old Testament volume familiar \
  to biblical Hebrew scholars. It contains the basic set of Unicode \
  characters needed for Biblical Hebrew texts following the typeface and \
  traditions of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia. You should expect to get \
  the same typographic features and diacritic placement as is found in the \
  printed Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia 1967/77, 1983.</p><p>If you require \
  a different style of typography, you should use a different font or you may \
  make your own, under the terms of the OFL. Please do not request of SIL \
  changes to the font that are not found in the BHS. Anyone can make their \
  own modified version of Ezra SIL (using a different name), but SIL \
  International will continue to maintain and develop the canonical version \
  of the Ezra SIL fonts. For information on what you're allowed to change \
  or modify, consult the OFL and OFL-FAQ.</p><p>At this point SIL is not \
  actively soliciting contributions to the project. Although they remain \
  the package maintainer, they do not currently plan major upgrades, but \
  will gratefully accept bug reports.</p>
