# OLD (2015) Google Fonts Files Archive

**This is an archive of the 2015 mercurial repo that was hosted on code.google.com and replaced with [github.com/google/fonts](https://github.com/google/fonts).
It contains 100s of source files (typically in VFB format) not available anywhere else.
For any issues, please file at [github.com/google/fonts/issues](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/new)**


This project contains the binary font files served by Google Fonts: http://www.google.com/fonts

This is not an official Google project, and Google provides no support for it.

The top level directories indicate the license of all files found within them.
Subdirectories are named according to the family name of the fonts within. 

Each family subdirectory contains the  `.ttf` font files served by Google Fonts, plus a `METADATA.json` file with metadata for the family, and a `DESCRIPTION.en_us.html` with a description of the family in US English.

Also [/designers](designers) contains a list of the Google+ pages for the fonts' designers.

## A Note On Licensing

Each font family directory contains the appropriate license file for the fonts in that directory and the fonts files themselves also contain licensing and authorship metadata.

Most of the fonts in the collection use the SIL Open Font License, v1.1.
Some fonts use the Apache 2 license. 
The Ubuntu fonts use the Ubuntu Font License v1.0. 

The SIL Open Font License has an option for copyright holders to include a Reserved Font Name requirement, please take care of this important detail.

## Source Files

Source files for each family are often available from the designer, or from https://github.com/googlefonts 

These fonts are usually the result of collaborative projects, where you are invited to discuss issues with the designers and even contribute to their on-going development.

When customising or remixing fonts, please do contact the designers to understand
what they might need in order to include your improvements.

Most of all: Enjoy the fonts!
