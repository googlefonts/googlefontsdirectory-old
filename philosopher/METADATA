description: <p> Philosopher was started in 2008 and \
  takes inspiration from Agfa Rotis and ITC Binary. This font \
  is universal: It can be used in logos, headlines, and for text. \
  The initial version of the font was deliberately spread with \
  errors - this was my invaluable contribution to type culture \
  around the world, as I thought then - I wanted to stir up \
  designers so they began working <strong>with</strong> fonts, \
  rather than passively using what is there. Over time I wanted \
  to correct the errors, and now the font has been used by \
  millions of people worldwide.</p> \
  <p>In June 2011 a four-style family was published, \
  and in September 2011 the full Latin and Cyrillic \
  family was fully hinted.</p>
