description: <p>Federo is a display webfont that \
  references Jakob Erbar's Feder Grotesk. The goal \
  was to keep the typeface as close as possible \
  to the original 1909 design while adapting it \
  for crisp web typography. Details were refined \
  and contrast was slightly reduced for \
  consistency. Figures obtained regular \
  proportions and counters were increased \
  for better legibility.</p> \
  <p>Designed by Olexa Volochay in 2011.</p>
