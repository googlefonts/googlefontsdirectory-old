FONTLOG for the Spiral fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Spiral Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Spiral fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

In geometry, a spiral is a curved line starting from a central 
point and moving progressively away and around that point. The 
Spiral font is inspired in this concept, trying to make you 
feel that you can go away from your starting point but youâ€™ll 
never be foreign. Spiral has a pronounced contrast and original 
curves. It can be used for headlines and shorter texts. Spiral
is cute at all sizes!

Spiral is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that
use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other
scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode ranges: Latin-1
