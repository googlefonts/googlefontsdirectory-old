description: <p>It's like Chinese food. We take the \
  chicken and mix it with pineapple. For one minute \
  we think that the taste will at least strange, but it \
  is so harmonious and beautiful, what do you know, \

  of neon tubes signage and a typewriter: A \
  thoroughbred mix of chicken and pineapple.</p>
