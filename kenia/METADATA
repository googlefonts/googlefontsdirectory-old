description: <p>Inspired by travel and my stay in Kenya, \
  I would fill my days with sketches and lettering. \
  From there Kenia evolved as a stencil display font. \
  With its text appearance in small point sizes \
  resembling an old German gothic sort of font, \
  modern-feel Kenia works for headlines, \
  introductory paragraphs, and in small text \
  setting. Its playful and friendly character \
  makes it suitable for happy typography in \
  magazines, blogs, online games and other \
  on-screen and print-based text.</p>
