description: <p>Cardo is a large Unicode font specifically designed for the needs of \
  classicists, Biblical scholars, medievalists, and linguists.  Since it may be used to \
  prepare materials for publication, it also contains features that are required for \
  high-quality typography, such as ligatures, text figures (also known as old style numerals), \
  true small capitals and a variety of punctuation and space characters.  It may also be used to \
  document and discuss the features of Unicode that are applicable to the these disciplines, \
  as we work to help colleagues understand the value (and limitations) of Unicode.</p> \
  <p>This font is my version of a typeface cut for the Renaissance printer Aldus Manutius \
  and first used to print Pietro Bemboâ€™s book De Aetna.  This font has been revived in modern \
  times under several names (Bembo, Aetna, Aldine 401).  I chose it mainly because it is a classic \
  book face, suitable for scholarship, and also because it is easier to get various diacritics sized \
  and positioned for legibility with this design than with some others.</p>
