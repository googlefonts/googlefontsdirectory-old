description: <p>Contrail is based on handmade sans \
  letters seen on UK posters. It's slight slant and \
  bouncy quality suggest the emerging jet age and a \
  state of both readiness and excited anticipation. \
  Its rounded corners give it an approachable \
  friendly feeling. Contrail is a low contrast \
  design that  is suitable for use in medium to \
  large sizes including headlines. This font \
  was made specifically to be used as web type.</p>
