This project contains the sources for the various libre/open fonts available in
Google Webfonts.

Please see http://google.com/webfonts for access to those fonts through
the Google webfonts API.

Each subdirectory contains fonts from a single designer. The .ttf font
files at the top level of each directory represent the files served
through the API. Various source files are often present in a src/ directory
under that in a variety of formats including cross-toolkit ones. Each directory
also contains a METADATA file (in simple Java properties file format, but UTF-8
encoding) with metadata for the font files.

Most fonts use the SIL Open Font License, version 1.1. A few fonts use the
Apache 2 license. Each directory contains the appropriate license file for the
fonts in that directory and the fonts files themselves also contain the
licensing and authorship metadata.

All the fonts in this project are libre/open fonts and many have upstream
websites when the corresponding designer hosts the project and makes releases:
you can find upstream information in the corresponding README.txt and
FONTLOG.txt.

When branching to modify or extend the fonts, please be mindful of the need to
use your own name and not conflict with existing namespace, reserved names, trademarks
and consider the recommended best practices to publish and merge changes
upstream.

Enjoy the fonts!

The Google webfonts team.
