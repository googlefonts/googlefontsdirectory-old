This project contains the binary and source files for the collection of 
libre/open fonts available in Google Web Fonts.

Please see http://www.google.com/webfonts for access to those fonts through
the Google Web Fonts API.

Each of the top level directories indicates the license of all fonts found
in further subdirectories that are named according to the family name of the
fonts within. 

The .ttf font files at the top level of each family directory are those served
through the Web Fonts API. Each directory contains a METADATA.json file with
metadata for the font files, and a DESCRIPTION.en_us.html with a description
of the family in US English. 

Most of the fonts in this use the SIL Open Font License, version 1.1. A few
fonts use the Apache 2 license. Each font family directory contains the
appropriate license file for the fonts in that directory and the fonts files
themselves also contain the licensing and authorship metadata.

Various source files for each family are usually present in a src/
subdirectory. All the fonts in this collection are libre/open fonts and many
have upstream websites where the corresponding designer hosts the project and
releases updates: you can find upstream information in the corresponding
FONTLOG.txt files.

When customising or remixing fonts, please remember that the SIL Open Font
License usually requires you to use your own family names to avoid conflicts
with original versions already installed, and other designers' trademarks. If
you are improving fonts, please contact the original designer to understand what they might need in order to include your improvements.

Most of all: Enjoy the fonts!
