This project contains the source files for fonts in the Google Font
Directory. Please see http://code.google.com/webfonts for access to
those fonts through the Google Font API.

Each subdirectory contains fonts from a single designer. The .ttf font
files at the top level of each directory represent the files served
through the API. Various source files are often present in a src/
directory under that. Each directory also contains a METADATA file
(in simple Java properties file format, but UTF-8 encoding) with
metadata for the file.

Most fonts use the SIL Open Font License, version 1.1. A few fonts use
the Apache 2 license. Each directory contains the appropriate license
file for the fonts in that directory.

Since all the fonts in this project are open source, many have
open source projects elsewhere. As with most open source
distributions, best practice is always to merge changes upstream.

Enjoy the fonts!
