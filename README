# Introduction to Google Fonts Project Repository

This project contains the binary and some source files for the Google Fonts
collection: <http://www.google.com/fonts>

Most of the top level directories indicate the license of all files found
within them. Subdirectories are named according to the family name of the
fonts within. Tools used for maintaining the collection are found in `/tools`
and a list of the Google+ pages for the fonts' designers is in `/designers`

The .ttf font files at the top level of each family directory are those served
through the Google Fonts API. Each directory contains a `METADATA.json` file
with metadata for the font files, and a `DESCRIPTION.en_us.html` with a
description of the family in US English.

# A Note On Licensing

Most of the fonts in the collection use the SIL Open Font License v1.1. Some
fonts use the Apache 2 license. The Ubuntu fonts use the Ubuntu Font License
v1.0. Each font family directory contains the appropriate license file for the
fonts in that directory and the fonts files themselves also contain the
licensing and authorship metadata.

Various source files for each family are usually present in a
`/license/family/src/` subdirectory. All the fonts in this collection are
libre licensed and many are developed as collaborative projects with
upstream websites where you can discuss issues with the designers and even
contribute to their on-going development.

When customising or remixing fonts, please remember that the SIL Open Font
License can have a Reserved Font Name requirement, so you must either rename 
the family or ask permission to use that name in your modified versions. If
you are improving fonts, please contact the original designer to understand
what they might need in order to include your improvements.

Most of all: Enjoy the fonts!
