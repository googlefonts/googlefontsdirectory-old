description: <p>Dancing Script is a lively casual \
  script where the letters bounce and change size \
  slightly. Caps are big, and goes below the baseline.</p> \
  <p>Dancing Script references popular scripts typefaces \
  from the 50's.</p> \
  <p>It relates to Murray Hill (Emil Klumpp. 1956) in \
  his weight distribution, and to Mistral (Roger Excoffon. \
  1953) in his lively bouncing effect.</p> \
  <p>Use it when you want a friendly, informal and \
  spontaneous look.</p>
