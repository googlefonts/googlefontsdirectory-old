description: <p>Zeyada is based on \
  the handwriting of a warm and \
  generous young mom.</p> \
  <p>Her family sponsors an amazing \
  Ethiopian young woman named \
  Zeyada and pays for her to \
  continue to be in school. \
  This font has curls and \
  curves and is not a typical \
  cursive, nor a typical print. \
  It is slightly connected, but \
  not a traditional script in \
  any way.</p>
