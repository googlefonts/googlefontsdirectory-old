description: <p>Luckiest Guy is a friendly \
  heavyweight sans-serif font inspired by \
  custom hand lettered 1950's advertisements. \
  Large and in charge, this offbeat, lovably \
  legible font lends itself to all sorts of uses.</p> \
  <p>Take Luckiest Guy for a spin and let him \
  pack a punch for both your website and your \
  design work.</p>
