profile: <p>I started out as a graphic designer and illustrator in 1976. During the early part of my career I worked as an art director on a number of magazines and other publications including Metropolis (a Minneapolis weekly, 1977), Machete (a Minneapolis broadsheet, 1978-80), TWA Ambassador (an inflight magazine, 1979-81), Minnesota Monthly (Minnesota Public Radio’s regional magazine, 1979-85), and the Utne Reader (1984-88).</p><p>I was head designer and art director for Minnesota Public Radio (1981-85) and an art director for its sister company, Rivertown Trading Company (1992-2000). During that time, I designed over 200 audio packages, including most of Garrison Keillor’s, along with several hundred products (t-shirts, mugs, rugs, watches, etc.) for the Wireless, Signals, and other mail order catalogs.</p><p>I frequently did lettering as part of design projects I worked on. This was always my favorite part, so in 2000 I opened my own shop specializing in lettering and typography.</p><p>I’ve also been interested in typeface design since my college days. I started licensing fonts to FontHaus in 1992, and since starting my new business, stepped up my efforts in developing original typefaces. I now have more than 100 fonts on the market with many more to come.</p><p>If you have a lettering or font project you would like me to take on, contact me by email at <a href="mailto:mark@ms-studio.com">mark@ms-studio.com</a> or by phone at +1-651-307-7491.</p>

# TODO 2010-12-04 DC Is having 2 names correct? Since the original designers don't have profiles, I think its okay, but maybe MD is better?

description: <p>Anonymous Pro is a family of four \
  fixed-width fonts designed especially with \
  coding in mind. Characters that could be \
  mistaken for one another (O, 0, I, l, 1, etc.) \
  have distinct shapes to make them easier to \
  tell apart in the context of source code.</p> \
  <p>Anonymous Pro also features an international, \
  Unicode-based character set, with support \
  for most Western and European Latin-based \
  languages, Greek, and Cyrillic. It also \
  includes special "box drawing" characters \
  for those who need them.</p> \
  <p>While Anonymous Pro looks great on Macs \
  and Windows PCs with antialiasing enabled, \
  it also includes embedded bitmaps for \
  specific pixel sizes ("ppems" in font nerd \
  speak) for both the regular and bold weight. \
  (Since slanted bitmaps look pretty bad and \
  hard to read at the supported sizes, I chose \
  to use the upright bitmaps for the italics \
  as well.) Bitmaps are included for these \
  ppems: 10, 11, 12, and 13. See the usage \
  notes below for info on what point sizes \
  these ppems correspond to on Mac and Windows.</p> \
  <p>Anonymous Pro is based on an earlier \
  font, Anonymous™, which was my TrueType \
  version of Anonymous 9, a freeware Macintosh \
  bitmap font developed in the mid-'90s by \
  Susan Lesch and David Lamkins. The bitmap \
  version was intended as a more legible \
  alternative to Monaco, the fixed-width \
  Macintosh system font.</p> \
  <p>Anonymous Pro differs from Anonymous™ \
  and Anonymous 9 in a few key characters. \
  While the earlier fonts had a one-story \
  lowercase "a" like Monaco, Anonymous Pro \
  features a two-story lowercase "a" to help \
  distinguish it from the "o". In the earlier \
  fonts, the slashed zero, designed to look \
  different than the capital "O", goes the \
  "wrong" way compared to most fonts that have \
  this feature. Susan and David did this \
  intentionally to distinguish it from the \
  slashed capital "Ø" used in some languages. \
  Some people thought this looked odd, so I \
  put it the "right" way, and distinguish it \
  from the "Ø" by keeping the slash inside \
  the character.</p> \
  <p>Another significant change was to \
  adjust the size of the characters in \
  relation to the point size. Anonymous™ \
  was approximately two sizes larger than \
  comparable fonts at the same point size. \
  This was in keeping with the old Monaco \
  font, but can be annoying when switching \
  between fonts. Anonymous Pro has been \
  adjusted so that it appears about the \
  same size as comparable fonts set at \
  the same point size. If you have been \
  using Anonymous™, you will need to \
  increase the point size to get the \
  same appearance.</p> \
  <p>Finally, unlike Anonymous™, Anonymous \
  Pro is available in one universal \
  TrueType format that will work on Mac \
  OS X, Windows, and GNU/Linux.</p> \
  <p>Anonymous Pro is distributed with \
  the SIL Open Font License.</p>
