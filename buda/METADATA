description: <p>Against the typographical grey, \
  Buda is a black and white typeface. The letters \
  are shared by two contrasting weights, which \
  clash and balance each other out. This typeface \
  is inspired by Budapest, a paradoxal town, \
  beautiful and ugly, fragile and exuberant. \
  Like this town, the typeface Buda is an \
  assemblage of heterogeneous elements which \
  form an harmony.</p>
