  Goblin One belongs to the category of display types \
  called "Latin". This is because of its sharp triangular \
  serifs. Goblin One was inspired by a hand painted sign \
  above a pub in the town of Reading (UK). Goblin One is \
  a somewhat wide medium contrast design with a large \
  x-height. Goblin One is both attention-getting and fun. \
  Goblin is suitable for use in medium to large sizes \
  including headlines. This font was made specifically \
  to be web type.
