description: <p>This font is based \
  on the handwriting of a perky, \
  cheerful young preschool teacher. \
  From her love of her Cedarville \
  University alma mater to her \
  passion for her students, she \
  is a delightful, dependable \
  person.  I think her handwriting \
  contains that same blend of \
  fun appeal with restrained \
  discipline alongside it. \
  Many handwritten script \
  fonts have large flourishes, \
  but this is a more simple \
  script, similar to authentic \
  daily handwriting.</p>
