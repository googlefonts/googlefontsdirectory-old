This directory contains a simple tool for subsetting fonts. It's most
useful for creating Latin subsets but can probably be extended to other
scripts.

Usage is subset.py (--options) <input-font.ttf> <output-font.ttf>

Options include:

  --new: create subset by creating new blank font and copying over
    relevant fields. This _definitely_ has the risk of missing things
    that are important. When not used, it deletes unused glyphs from
    the font.

  --string=: Generate subset for just the specified string. Useful for
    creating a menu subset. Generally we use subset.pl from Font
    Optimizer for this, however.

  --simplify: Strip out hints and do curve optimization. Can make
    fonts much smaller but generally a quality degradation on Windows
    machines.

  --strip_names: Strips most name tables from the font. Use with
    caution, as the result may not satisfy adequate attribution and
    licensing.

  --script: Run the subset as a separate .pe (pfaedit)
    file. Conceptually it should make no difference, but it's a
    workaround for fontforge segfaults in the Python interface.

Things to watch for:

The kerning tables (and very likely other OpenType tables) are
sometimes left with hanging references to deleted glyphs. Generally
that's fairly harmless, but it does increase file size and create
warnings.
