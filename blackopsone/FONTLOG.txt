FONTLOG for the Black Ops One font

This file provides detailed information on the Black Ops One 
Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Black Ops One font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Black Ops One is a low contrast semi geometric typeface inspired 
by military stencil lettering. Black Ops is heavy, sturdy, 
and punchy. Because of the small cuts found in stencils 
like this one, Black Ops will look best when used at 
medium to large sizes.

Black Ops is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded 
to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
