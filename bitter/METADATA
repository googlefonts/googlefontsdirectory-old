description: <p>People read and interact with \
  text on screens more and more \
  each day. What happens on screen ends up being more important \
  than what comes out of the printer. With the accelerating \
  popularity of electronic books, type designers are working \
  hard to seek out the ideal designs for reading on screen.</p> \
  <p>Motivated by my love for the pixel I designed Bitter. \
  A "contemporary" slab serif typeface for text, it is \
  specially designed for comfortably reading on any \
  computer or device. The robust design started from \
  the austerity of the pixel grid, based on rational \
  rather than emotional principles. It combines the \
  large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic \
  tradition with subtle characteristics in the \
  characters that inject a certain rhythm to \
  flowing texts.</p> \
  <p>Bitter has little variation in stroke weight and \
  the Regular is thicker than a normal ‘Regular’ \
  style for print design. This generates an intense \
  color in paragraphs, accentuated by the serifs \
  that are as thick as strokes with square terminals.</p> \
  <p>Each glyph is carefully designed with an excellent \
  curve quality added to the first stage of the \
  design, that was entirely made in a pixel grid. \
  The typeface is balanced and manually spaced to use \
  very few kerning pairs, especially important for web \
  font use since most browsers do not currently support \
  this feature.</p> \
  <p>Early versions of the Italic and Bold styles were \
  added in December 2011 and will be updated and complemented \
  by a Bold Italic in early 2012.</p> \
