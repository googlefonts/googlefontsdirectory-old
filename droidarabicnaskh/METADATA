description: <p>Droid Arabic Naskh is an Arabic type designed \
  for use in Google™ products such as Google ChromeOS™ and \
  Android™. Designed to complement the Latin, Greek and \
  Cyrillic provided in the Droid Serif family, the Arabic \
  matches the color, alignment and design detail of the Droid \
  Serif allowing them to be used together for multi-lingual \
  typesetting. This Naskh style is optimized for reading Arabic \
  script on screen. The large ‘loop height’ and ‘tooth height’ \
  help prevent readers from having to zoom web pages to a \
  larger size in order to read them. The traditional Naskh forms \
  are softened for less formal documents such as periodicals and \
  journals. The letterforms structures are based on the \
  calligraphic grammatical rules of the Naskh writing style while \
  drawn with a contemporary feel.</p>
