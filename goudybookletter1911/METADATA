description: <p>Based on Frederic Goudy’s Kennerley Oldstyle. \
  A few words on why I think Kennerley Oldstyle is beautiful: \
  In making this font, I discovered that Kennerley fits together \
  tightly and evenly with almost no kerning. Thus the \
  following words from Monotype specimen books are just: \
  “[W]hen composed into words the characters appear to \
  lock into one another with a closeness common in early \
  types, but not so often seen in later-day creations.” \
  These are letters that take command of the space around \
  them; notice, for instance, the bowed shapes of the v \
  and w.</p>
