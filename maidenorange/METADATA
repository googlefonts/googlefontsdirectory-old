description: <p>Maiden Orange is a light and festive \
  slab serif font inspired by custom hand lettered \
  1950's advertisements. Clean and legible, while \
  also being offbeat and friendly, this font lends \
  itself to a wide variety of uses.</p> \
  <p>From children's stories to the retro inspired, \
  take Maiden Orange for a spin and let her liven \
  up both your website and your design work.</p>
