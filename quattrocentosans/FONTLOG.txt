Basic Font Information

The Quattrocento Sans typeface is a Classic, Elegant, Sober and Strong typeface.

Their wide and open letterforms, and the great x-height, make it very legible 
for body text at small sizes. And their tiny details that only shows up at 
bigger sizes make it also great for display use.

Some of their distinctive characteristics are:
- Low Contrast. The thins are just a tad thiner than the thicks, almost 
  monotone.
- Cupped, tapered stems that flows naturally.
- Distinctive K, R and & tail.
- Cupped B, D, E, F, P, Q, R and T.
- The Q is a humble expression of admiration and gratitude for 
  Doyald Young.
- Alternate M, Two W alternates .
- Narrow L, T for better fit.

Quattrocento Sans is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that
use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other
scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode ranges: Latin-1
