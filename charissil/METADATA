description: <p>Charis is similar to Bitstream Charter, \
  one of the first fonts designed specifically for laser \
  printers. It is highly readable and holds up well in \
  less-than-ideal reproduction environments. It also has \
  a full set of styles - regular, italic, bold, bold italic \
  - and so is more useful in general publishing than \
  Doulos SIL. Charis is a serif proportionally spaced font \
  optimized for readability in long printed documents.</p> \
  <p>The goal for this product was to provide a single \
  Unicode-based font family that would contain a \
  comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any \
  Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for \
  phonetic or orthographic needs. In addition, there is \
  provision for other characters and symbols useful to \
  linguists. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font \
  technologies to support complex typographic issues, such \
  as the need to position arbitrary combinations of base \
  glyphs and diacritics optimally.</p> \
  <p>The design of the basic character set of Charis SIL \
  is similar (but not identical) to Bitstream Charter, \
  designed by Matthew Carter.</p>
