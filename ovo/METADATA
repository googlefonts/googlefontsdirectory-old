description: <p>Ovo was inspired by a set of hand \
  lettered caps seen in a 1930's lettering guide. \
  The capitals suggested the time in which they were \
  made because of the soft serif treatment used. \
  This detail and a subtle casual feeling creeping \
  into the otherwise classical forms led to the \
  soft genial lowercase and the whimsical numbers \
  now seen in Ovo. Ovo is a medium contrast serif \
  font. Because of the old style variable letter \
  widths and subtle detail it will work best at \
  medium to large sizes.</p>
