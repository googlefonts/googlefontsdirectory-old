description: <p>Amaranth is an upright italic; a clean sans \
  style provides very good readibility for web purposes \
  and the Italic features add a very distinctive, playful \
  and above all friendly character for display uses. \
  There are currently very few upright italics available \
  to designers that offer an extra bit of typographical \
  refinement and innovativeness.</p>
