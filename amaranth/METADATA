description: <p>Amaranth is an upright italic; a clean sans \
  style provides very good readibility for web purposes \
  and the Italic features add a very distinctive, playful \
  and above all friendly character for display uses. \
  There are currently very few upright italics available \
  to designers that offer an extra bit of typographical \
  refinement and innovativeness.</p>

# The Amaranth family is a friendly upright italic design 
# with a slight contrast and distinctive curves. With its 
# three new weights Amaranth is also healthy for all your texts too!
