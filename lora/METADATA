description: <p>Lora is a well-balanced contemporary \
  serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface \
  with moderate contrast well suited for body text.<p> \
  <p>A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable \
  appearance because of its brushed curves in contrast \
  with driving serifs. The overall typographic voice \
  of Lora perfectly conveys the mood of a modern-day \
  story, or an art essay.</p> \
  <p>Technically Lora is optimised for screen \
  appearance, and works equally well in print.</p>
