description: <p>Yellowtail is an old school flavored \
  flat brush script typeface of medium weight. It's \
  mix of connecting and non-connecting letterforms \
  lend to its unique look and legibility. Yellowtail \
  nods to classic 1930's typestyles like Gillies \
  Gothic & Kaufmann, yet has the loose visual \
  cadence of sign painter scripts.</p>
