description: <p>Allerta is an open \
  source typeface designed for use \
  in signage. Allerta  was designed \
  to be easily and quickly read from \
  a distance. Each letter exploits \
  the most unique aspects of that \
  individual letter so that each \
  character can be easily distinguished \
  from any other. Initially published at \
