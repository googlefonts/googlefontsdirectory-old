description: <p>Francois One is a reworking of traditional \
  sans serif gothic display typeface forms. \
  In Francois One, the earlier letter forms have been \
  digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont, \
  the counters have been opened \
  up a little and the stems optimised for use as bold \
  display font in modern web browsers. Slanted stem \
  terminals have been added to give the face added visual play.</p>
