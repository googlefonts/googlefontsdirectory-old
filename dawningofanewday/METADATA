description: <p>Dawning of a New Day is based on the \
  handwriting of a friend.  The title was chosen by \
  my friend, but also had great meaning to me. \
  I like to think of each new day as a chance to \
  start fresh, free from past mistakes. It is my \
  desire that the light, fluid motions of this \
  script mimic that hopeful feeling.</p>
