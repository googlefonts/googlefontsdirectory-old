description: <p>Dawning of a New Day is based on the handwriting of a friend.  The title was chosen by my friend, but also had great meaning to me.  I like to think of each new day as a chance to start fresh, free from past mistakes.  It is my desire that the light, fluid motions of this script mimic that hopeful feeling.</p>


profile: <p>I enjoy creative arts of every kind including theater, photography, and graphic design.  After graduating with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Liberal Studies, I became a stay-at-home mom.   Creating fonts allowed me to use my love of art in a new way while I was at home with my daughters.</p><p>I am passionate about God, orphan care, and sustainable development.  I enjoy studying languages in my spare time.  I live in Tianjin, China with my husband and 2 daughters.</p>
