description: <p>This ain’t no Lucida. League Script #1 \
  is a modern, coquettish script font that sits somewhere \
  between your high school girlfriend’s love notes and \
  handwritten letters from the ’20s. Designed for \
  <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com">the \
  League of Moveable Type</a>, it includes ligatures \
  and will act as the framework for future script \
  designs.</p>
