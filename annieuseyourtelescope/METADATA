description: <p>This is a favorite of mine.  A talented \
  photography student I know was writing something down \
  and I squealed and ran over to beg her for a sample of \
  her writing.  It was worth the effort, as I adore her \
  style and feel it translated perfectly into a cute font. \
  She named the font as a nod to one of her favorite \
  bands, Jack’s Mannequin.</p>
