description: <p>Neuton is a clean, dark, somewhat \
  Dutch-inspired serif font which reminds you a little \
  of Times. It has a large height, short extenders, \
  and a compact width for better screen use, and \
  economy of space.</p> \
  <p>The family will comprise a regular, italic, and \
  cursive, each in five weights and with smallcaps. \
  Two italics &mdash; one will be called "italic", and the \
  other "cursive" &mdash; are uncommon, but very useful. \
  Ever tried emphasizing something already emphasized? \
  Beyond that obvious example, there are other uses.</p> \
  <p>Sometimes a text needs a different flavor or \
  feel. While one roman can work for a variety of \
  texts, the companion italics don't always. In \
  more classical or personal documents, a stiff, \
  sober, modern and down-to-earth italic will \
  never work. And in many essays, some of the \
  fancier italics look ridiculous. Who said a \
  roman needs only one companion?</p>
