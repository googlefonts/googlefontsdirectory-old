description: <p>Expletus is Latin for ‘perfect’. \
  Expletus Sans is a display face that adds style and \
  class to your webpage, without drawing the attention \
  away too much. The elegant way the gaps are shaped \
  create a welcome tension between the black and the \
  whitespace and give it an open and reliable look. \
  Expletus Sans was designed with love and dedication, \
  perfected in every detail. The four weights give you \
  plenty of choice and allow you to use it extensively. \
  Next to web use, Expletus Sans also adds that \
  special ‘touch’ to identity work and other printed \
  matter. If you have any problems with Expletus \
  Sans, or you would like to use it for a language \
  it doesn’t support, please contact me at \
