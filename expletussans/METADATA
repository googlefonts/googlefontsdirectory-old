description: <p>Expletus Sans is a display \
  typeface, which means that it is not \
  recommended for long pieces of text. \
  However, it's very effective for setting \
  headers and other large sized text, due \
  to its way of pulling in the reader. \
  It comes in 4 weights and includes \
  italics. Its character \
  set supports most European languages, \
  but if you do wish to have several \
  extra glyphs made to support your \
  language, please don't hesitate to \
  send an email to <a \
  href="mailto:jasper@designtown.nl">jasper@designtown.nl</a></p>
  <p>Any critique and/or other questions \
  can also be emailed to the above address.</p> \
  <p>Expletus Sans came to life in the \
  mind of a young, ambitious boy, Jasper \
  de Waard. It was a single x in a logo \
  that triggered a chain of thoughts which \
  would eventually turn into Expletus \
  Sans' most obvious character trait. \
  Ever since Jasper started thinking and \
  working with type he was intrigued by \
  stencil typefaces. The way taking out \
  something can add so much to the look \
  of a letter fascinated him. Although \
  Expletus Sans is not a true stencil \
  typeface it builds upon that idea. \
  The gaps are formed in a way that \
  adds a look of dimension in the \
  negative space, resulting in texts \
  that attracts the reader, while not \
  taking the attention away too much \
  from the text. Apart from the love \
  and devotion that Jasper de Waard \
  put into Expletus Sans he was also \
  supported a lot by several people \
  on various websites, resulting in \
  a higher degree of perfection.</p>
