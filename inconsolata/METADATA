description: <p>Inconsolata is my first serious original font release. It is a monospace font, \
  designed for printed code listings and the like. There are a great many "programmer fonts," \
  designed primarily for use on the screen, but in most cases do not have the attention to detail \
  for high resolution rendering.</p> \
  <p>Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources. I was particularly struck by the beauty \
  of Luc(as) de Groot's Consolas, which is his monospaced design for Microsoft's Vista \
  release. This font, similar to his earlier TheSansMono, demonstrated clearly to me that monospaced \
  fonts do not have to suck.</p>
  <p>First and foremost, Inconsolata is a humanist sans design. I strove for the clarity and clean \
  lines of Adrian Frutiger's Avenir (the lowercase "a", in particular, pays homage to this wonderful \
  design), but also looked to Morris Fuller Benton's Franklin Gothic family for guidance on some of \
  my favorite glyphs, such as lowercase "g" and "S", and, most especially, the numerals.</p> \
  <p>Designing a monospace font poses unique challenges. I have carefully studied many other monospaced \
  fonts to see how they solve these problems. Many of the available monospace fonts are adaptations of \
  existing proportionally-spaced fonts, but some, such as Letter Gothic, draw strength from being their \
  own designs. I hope Inconsolata upholds that tradition.</p> \
  <p>Some details will be most apparent in print, such as the subtle curves in lowercase "t", "v", "w", \
  and "y". Inconsolata also borrows "micro-serifs" from some Japanese Gothic fonts, which enhance the \
  appearance of crispness and legibility.</p>
