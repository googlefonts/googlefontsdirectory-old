SOURCES
Gentium v1.2
========================


This file describes the source files included with the Gentium font family. This information should be distributed along with the Gentium fonts and any derivative works.

As a reminder: these source files are Copyright (c) 2003-2005, SIL International (http://scripts.sil.org/). All Rights Reserved.

No modification of the license is permitted, only verbatim copy is allowed.


Note that the primary source files for the fonts are the fonts themselves. They contain all the important data in the fonts and can be studied and modified using open font tools such as FontForge and TTX (which can both export to text-based formats). To make further development easier we provide some additional files:

FontLab "*-designsource.vfb" files: These .vfb files are FontLab source files (one for each font weight) and contain all the glyph outline data for the Gentium fonts. Please note that it is not possible to generate fonts from these files that are identical to the final versions, as some postprocessing is done on the fonts after generation from FontLab. They are provided solely as a source for PostScript-style b√©zier outlines.
