description: <p>Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) \
  is a Unicode typeface family designed to enable the many \
  diverse ethnic groups around the world who use the Latin \
  script to produce readable, high-quality publications. \
  The design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably \
  compact, and visually attractive. Gentium has won a \
  "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface Design" in two major \
  international typeface design competitions: bukva:raz! \
  (2001), TDC2003 (2003).</p><p>Gentium provides glyphs for \
  a wide range of Latin and Greek characters. The additional \
  'extended' Latin letters are designed to naturally \
  harmonize with the traditional 26 ones. Diacritics are \
  treated with careful thought and attention to their use.</p> \
  <p>A future version will include a completely revised set, \
  including italic and bold, and will expand the support \
  for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic to Unicode 4.1.</p>

font.GentiumAlt-Regular.ttf.description: <p>GentiumAlt is \
  a version of the font with redesigned diacritics (flatter	\
  ones) to make it more suitable for use with stacking \
  diacritics, and for languages such as Vietnamese. The \
  Greek glyphs also use the Porsonic (single-curve) design \
  for the circumflex. Since Gentium does not currently include \
  any 'smart' rendering routines, there is no easy way to \
  access these alternate diacritic shapes from within the \
  regular Gentium font. The encoding of the fonts are the \
  same, so the same text can be viewed with either one. \
  There is also no problem with having both font families \
  installed at the same time.</p>
