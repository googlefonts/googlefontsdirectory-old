description: <p>Gochi Hand is a typographic interpretation \
  of the handwriting of a teenage girl. The style is fresh, \
  not like the letters made by a calligrapher, but those of an \
  ordinary person. The text line is spontaneous but solid \
  and consistent, expressive and works well on screen, \
  even in small sizes. The glyphs were carefully designed \
  with a good curve quality that makes it able to look good \
  when printed too.</p>
