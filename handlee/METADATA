description: <p>Handlee is loosely based on \
  the handwriting of typographer Joe Prince. \
  Its inconsistent curves give it a nice, \
  human-like quality that is reflected in \
  the characters. Each glyph is stationed \
  at a different position in respect to the \
  baseline, and ascenders and descenders vary, \
  which all contribute to the human-like \
  qualities of the font.</p> \
  <p>Handlee is a great font for any web \
  page looking to add some personality and \
  charisma. There was careful \
  attention to detail in removing unnecessary \
  overlap between letters, which allows Handlee \
  to be scaled down to very small sizes while \
  still maintaining legibility.</p> \
  <p>The diaritics were purposefully designed \
  at a slightly larger scale than normal to \
  add to the ability to be scaled down. Also, \
  the accents on the accented characters were \
  not automatically generated but were rather \
  hand placed individually to portray \
  asymmetry and inconsistency that is \
  typically found in handwriting.</p> \
  <p>All of the little details and careful \
  considerations in Handlee make it the \
  perfect font for any project.</p>
