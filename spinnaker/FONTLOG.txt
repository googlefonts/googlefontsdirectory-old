FONTLOG for the Spinnaker font

This file provides detailed information on Spinnaker 
Font Software. This information should be distributed along 
with the Spinnaker font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Spinaker is based on French and UK lettering found on 
posters for travel by ship. Spinaker is a low contrast 
slightly wide sans serif design. Spinaker has a whimsy 
youthful sense of play to offer in addition to the expected 
utility that a sans design commonly offers. Spinaker 
is suitable for medium to large sizes.

Spinnaker is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be 
expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
