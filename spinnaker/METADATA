description: <p>Spinnaker is based on French and UK \
  lettering found on posters for travel by ship. Spinnaker \
  is a low contrast and slightly wide Sans Serif design. \
  It has a whimsy youthful sense of play to \
  offer, in addition to the expected utility that a \
  sans design commonly offers. Spinnaker is suitable \
  for use in medium to large sizes.</p>
