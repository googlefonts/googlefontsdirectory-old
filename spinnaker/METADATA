description: <p>Spinnaker is based on French and UK \
  lettering found on posters for travel by ship. Spinaker \
  is a low contrast slightly wide Sans serif design. \
  Spinaker has a whimsy youthful sense of play to \
  offer in addition to the expected utility that a \
  sans design commonly offers. Spinaker is suitable \
  for medium to large sizes.</p>
