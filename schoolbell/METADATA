description: <p>Do you hear it? It's the sweet \
  sound that let's you know when it's time to eat \
  lunch in the cafeteria, head out to recess, or \
  hop on the bus to head home! It's Schoolbell, \
  the delightfully playful handwriting font from \
  the finest lettering artist in the 2nd Grade!</p>
