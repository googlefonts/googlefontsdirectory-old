description: <p>Syncopate was designed in 2010 as \
  a headline and display typeface.</p> \
  <p>Light in weight with a wide body width, \
  it is a unicase design where the traditional \
  lowercase x-height has been abandoned and a \
  single uppercase height rules the design of \
  all of the alpha and numeric glyphs. Some \
  uppercase glyphs are copied to their lowercase \
  slots, where other lowercase glyphs such \
  as the a, e, and r, are scaled up to \
  uppercase heights. This motif allows \
  for a vast array of setting possibilities.</p> \
  <p>Though intended for display, Syncopate \
  does work well for limited text runs. \
  The letter forms are a modern and stylish \
  sans serif inspired by the many trendy \
  sans serif typefaces that are so \
  prevalent today. The lighter weight \
  and wide body impart a certain level \
  of elegance, while the unicase \
  approach keeps the look lively \
  and fresh.</p>
