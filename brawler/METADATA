description: <p>Brawler is a compact typeface with sharp \
  features and a sturdy character, designed for comfortable \
  reading in small sizes. It was initially planned as a \
  typeface for newspapers and tabloids. Thus, the design \
  concept was shaped by the demands of low quality printing \
  media and the aesthetic preferences of periodical \
  publications.</p>
