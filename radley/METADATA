description: <p>The design of Radley grew \
  out of of a series of lettercarving works, \
  basically sketching and designing directly \
  into wood with traditional carving chisels, \
  to design the basic letterforms of a new \
  typeface.The finalised characters were then \
  scanned and traced into FontForge before \
  being cleaned up digitally and the \
  character set expanded. There is something \
  unique about carving letters into wood with \
  traditional hand tools, hopefully Radley \
  carries some of the original spirit of \
  these hand carved letterforms.</p>
