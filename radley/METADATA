description: <p>Radley is a display font, designed \
  from woodcarved lettering. It is a practical face, \
  based on letterforms used by hand carvers, where \
  lettering needs to be cut quickly, efficiently, \
  but with style.</p> \
  <p>Radley grew out of sketching and designing \
  directly into wood with traditional carving \
  chisels, to design the basic letterforms of \
  a new typeface.The finalised characters were \
  then scanned and traced into FontForge before \
  being cleaned up digitally and the character \
  set expanded. There is something unique about \
  carving letters into wood with traditional \
  hand tools, hopefully Radley carries some \
  of the original spirit of these hand \
  carved letterforms.</p>
