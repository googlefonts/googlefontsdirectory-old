description: <p>Radley is based on lettering \
  originally drawn and designed for woodcarved \
  titling work. Radley was later digitised \
  and extended to be used as a webfont. \
  It is a practical face, \
  based on letterforms used by hand carvers, where \
  lettering needs to be cut quickly, efficiently, \
  but with style.</p> \
  <p>Radley grew out of sketching and designing \
  directly into wood with traditional carving \
  chisels, to design the basic letterforms of \
  a new typeface.The finalised characters were \
  then scanned and traced into FontForge before \
  being cleaned up digitally and the character \
  set expanded. There is something unique about \
  carving letters into wood with traditional \
  hand tools, hopefully Radley carries some \
  of the original spirit of these hand \
  carved letterforms.</p> \
  Radley can be used for titling and text. \
  It has been designed to be used freely \
  across the internet by web browsers on \
  desktop computers, laptops and \
  mobile devices.</p>
