description: <p>Michroma is a reworking and remodelling of \
  the rounded-square sans genre that is closely associated \
  with a 1960s feeling of the future. This is due to the \
  popularity of Microgramma, designed by Aldo Novarese and \
  Alessandro Buttiin in 1952, which pioneered the style; \
  and the most famous typeface family of the genre that \
  came 10 years later in Novarese’s Eurostile.</p> \
  <p>Michroma has character widths and stem weights perfectly \
  formed to fit today's digital screens; Vernon Adams has \
  pioneered a design process with this font that produces \
  excellent results on screen with no manual hinting \
  involved.</p>
