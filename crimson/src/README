Changes (2010-July-28):

- Support for Latin-Extended-A with the exception of one or two historical shapes; so most Western languages should be supported now
- Serifs are all the same now within one weight/style. In fact, they're a bit sturdier and longer than they were before
- Added a ton of f-ligatures to each weight/style
- The roman versions already contain old style numerals and small caps (experimental); italics will follow soon
- Started Greek in the Roman Regular (very experimental)
- Fixed up some italic letters
- Used FontForge's autospacing on all fonts; the results are, obviously, terrible.
- Experimenting with a lc "f" with shorter terminal for overlapping cases. Implemented as an almost-correctly working calt-feature in the Roman Regular. I favour this approach over ligatures, actually

You see there's a lot left to do. I hopefully don't have to deter you from using it publicly (yet) to save you some embarassment.

If you can help with ...

- positioning diacritics
- improving spacing and kerning
- adding math characters
- advice of any sort
- improving the greek shapes
- creating flourishes or ornaments
- scripting FontForge to speed up tedious work
- creating Multiple Master templates so we can have optical scaling
- encouraging ego boosts
- anything else
