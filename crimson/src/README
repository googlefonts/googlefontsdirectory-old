You see there's a lot left to do. I hopefully don't have to deter you from using it publicly (yet) to save you some embarassment.

If you can help with ...

- positioning diacritics
- improving spacing and kerning
- adding math characters
- advice of any sort
- improving the greek shapes
- creating flourishes or ornaments
- scripting FontForge to speed up tedious work
- creating Multiple Master templates so we can have optical scaling
- encouraging ego boosts
- anything else

... fire me an email at sebastian@aldusleaf.org. Thanks.

========== CHANGELOG ===========

Changes (2010-August-31):

- Reworked the entire Roman and Bold, generated most of Semibold. (excl. small caps, though)
- Reworked lining numerals in the Roman and Italic; new oldstyle figures in the Italic as well
- A complete new Italic, thanks to Alan Robiette's suggestions. Changes will be reviewed and then adopted in BI and SBI


Changes (2010-August-19):

- Fixed some letters and numerals in Regular Roman & Italic. Looks a lot better now.


Changes (2010-August-17):

- Revamped many letters in Roman and Italic
- Added ordinals, subscripts; scientific superscripts and inferiors. Each contains numbers, punctuation, a lowercase and an uppercase latin alphabet
- Added Latin-Extended-A small caps
- Added small cap lining figures
- Fixed Greek ductus in the Roman weight


Changes (2010-July-28):

- Support for Latin-Extended-A with the exception of one or two historical shapes; so most Western languages should be supported now
- Serifs are all the same now within one weight/style. In fact, they're a bit sturdier and longer than they were before
- Added a ton of f-ligatures to each weight/style
- The roman versions already contain old style numerals and small caps (experimental); italics will follow soon
- Started Greek in the Roman Regular (very experimental)
- Fixed up some italic letters
- Used FontForge's autospacing on all fonts; the results are, obviously, terrible.
- Experimenting with a lc "f" with shorter terminal for overlapping cases. Implemented as an almost-correctly working calt-feature in the Roman Regular. I favour this approach over ligatures, actually
