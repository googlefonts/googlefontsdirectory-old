description: <p>Presenting Irish Growler! No, it's not a \
  coveted new AKC breed. No, it's not a tasty seasonal \
  pilsner. It's a fun, flamboyant, new display font by \
  Squid that's way better than any of those possibilities. \
  Sure and it's free for Pete's sake! And you can't say \
  that about dogs or beer.</p>
